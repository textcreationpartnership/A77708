            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Expoſition of famous Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>'s Catechiſm, was the work of Maſter <hi>Charles Broxolm;</hi> a good man, who was well known to your noble Lord; whoſe great favours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, hath engag'd me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of his wiſdom (my dear Aunt) to dedicate it unto your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

               <hi>Madam,</hi> This Book had ſooner been brought into publick view, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of our broken times had not diſcompoſed peoples ſpirits, to give due entertainment unto ſuch uſeful Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes. Many in theſe latter dayes, have wofully diſputed away the life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and power of Godlineſs; whence it is, that their Spiritual Appetite to ſalubrious Truths, is extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed;
<pb facs="tcp:119999:3"/>and their Sun-ſhine, is like the Winters light, altogether without holy heat. It was an high commendation of the Chriſtian Romans, by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that they were <hi>full of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and filled with all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Rom. 15.14.</hi> and it is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that this good couple ſhould ever be divided. As practical Profeſsion moſt glorifieth God, ſo it winneth moſt eſtimation amongſt good Chriſtians. The end of this Treatiſe, is to edifie Gods people in both; therefore if I ſhould dare to keep this piece ſecret, (which the Reverend Authour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Publick uſe) I ſhould not onely fruſtrate the intentions of the dead, and deceive his godly friends li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but alſo rob the Church of that which is her right.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any of you, have had real impreſſions of love upon your hearts, towards my worthy Uncle, the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Expoſition: you have fully known his Doctrine, manner of life, purpoſe, faith, Long ſuffering, Charity, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Humility. That which you have heard with the Ear, is
<pb facs="tcp:119999:5"/>now (according to your deſire) repreſented to your Eye.</p>
            <p>There is a great diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a lively voyce, and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs lines; the one moveth more, but the other profiteth more; the one ſoon paſſeth away with the ſound of words, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abideth, giveth the Reader leave to pauſe and conſider. Good mens works (being Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) do not onely reach them who are alive, but thoſe alſo who are unborn; and not to them alone who are near, but ſuch likewiſe who are afar off. It was the Authors deſire, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taught you theſe things, you might after his deceaſe,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.</note> have them alwaies in
<pb facs="tcp:119999:5"/>remembrance; and therefore this Expoſition according to his order was tranſcribed for the Preſs when he dyed. Now he is taken out of your ſight; but if you yet deſire communion with him, it muſt be, by walking in that track which he hath here chalked out before you, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to tread the ſteps of his Religious, zealous converſation; who herein (though dead) ſtill ſpeaketh unto you. This birth was conceived and brought forth firſtly for you, therefore though others ſhould deſpiſe it, yet you will (I hope) give it good welcom; becauſe it reviveth the memory of him, who (whilſt he lived) ceaſed not to

Add Prayer unto your reading, that you may find the power of thoſe Truths warming your hearts. 2. Make practice your end in ſeeking knowledge: for <hi>That ſervant that knoweth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will and doth it not,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:119999:6"/>and that when others had their Religion onely at their tongues end, yours might appear in your lives. 3. Attend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon the Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of your faithful Paſtors and Teachers.

Perkins) <hi>which</hi> for above <hi>50</hi> years, have been much approved, and improved in the Church of <hi>England</hi> and elſwhere, for the inſtruction of many thouſands in matters neceſſary to ſalvation. Theſe needful Principles are here familiarly, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, both confirmed and applyed, for thy ſpiritual advantage: and doubtleſs, there is more then ordinary need of ſuch helps, in theſe Apoſtatizing, erroneous times;
<pb facs="tcp:119999:8"/>wherein the chief Articles of faith, are either impudently queſtioned, or irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſlighted. There is no means more promiſing to reclaim wanderers, and to eſtabliſh waverers in the truth, then by recalling them unto the ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt grounds of Religion: for by this means, people would find ſure foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their faith, and alſo grow able to defend fundamentals againſt gain-ſayers, when others are like Veſſels without Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, which float hither and thither, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different motion of every wind and wave, which doth aſſault them. Many godly perſons, who reaped ſoul-fruit from this ſeed when firſt ſown, by theſe Sermons when firſt preached, bave impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned the Printing of them (according to the Authors own intention) for their own further benefit, and for the edification of many others. The Sermons do breath the holineſs and plainneſs of the Preachers ſpirit, who was very laborious and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous in the work of his Miniſtry. And although they be not ſo Notional and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical,
<pb facs="tcp:119999:8"/>as many may deſire; yet they are ſubſtantially profitable, and fitted to the capacity of ſuch, who moſt need them.

As curious ſights do not fill empty bellies, ſo neither doth gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy language feed hungry ſouls. Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Maſter <hi>Greenham</hi> was bold, to call the Miniſtry <hi>Glaſſy, Bright,</hi> and <hi>Brittle;</hi> (foreſeeing that vanity growing up in the Church in his dayes) wherein ingenuity and affectation of words, was preferred before ſolidity of ſavory matter.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat <hi>there is a God:</hi> There be three Books wherein we may read this great Truth: 1. The Book of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> 2. The Book of the <hi>Creatures.</hi> 3. The Book of <hi>Nature.</hi> Firſt, the Book of the Scriptures: as oft as God is mentioned in holy Writ ſo oft (upon the matter) it is affirmed that there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119999:10"/>is a God: Now this is a great demonſtration, the Scriptures affirming a thing to be ſo. But come we to the ſecond Book, the Book of the Creatures; ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> The meaning of the Apoſtle is, That there is a God, as is plain by the very Book of the Creatures; and not a few Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in this kind may be deduced hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. As firſt, From the Original of the Creatures or world. They either had a beginning or not a beginning: If we ſay, Not a beginning, then we make the world God; all the Creatures from the leaſt to the greateſt, God. For to have their being from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without beginning, is nothing elſe but to be God (what hath a being of it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, is God). But to affirm the world to be God, or the ſeveral Creatures therein to be God, were not this abſurd and brutiſh?</p>
                  <p>If we ſay, They had a beginning, the world and Creatures, as is very evident; who then was their beginner and Maker, but God? Why then, there is a God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The Creatures being many, are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119999:10"/>all referred to their ſeveral and peculiar ends; and ſo they all work and are imployed. Now hence it is plain and evident, that there is one above them all, who did aim at theſe ends in them, that did create them to theſe ends; and who is this but God? why then, there is a God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The comely order and beauty which may be obſerved in the worlds great variety, evidence, There is a God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Man himſelf, confidered from the reſt of the Creatures, who may be termed the Epitome of the world, or <hi>Microcoſmos,</hi> the little world: Mans body reviewed, is it not a wonderous and curious piece of work? as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14, 15. But his ſoul eſpecially, (that imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, immortal, inviſible ſubſtance) with the faculties of it, and the great acts of thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Do not all theſe conclude a wiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Creator, and ſo a God?</p>
                  <p>The third Book wherein this great truth may be read, is the Book of Nature: Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them;</hi> that is to ſay, Is writ in the hearts of the old Gentiles, and ſo in the hearts of all men; not all that may be known of God, but ſo much that there is a God, becauſe God hath ſhewed it unto them, that is, hath writ it in
<pb facs="tcp:119999:11"/>their hearts by a general work of his Spirit; and ſo that place may be underſtood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9 <hi>That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> to wit, with the light of nature, in a great meaſure, or in a leſs; and this we call the Book of Nature. Among thoſe common notions imprinted in mans heart ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, this is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal one, <hi>That there is a God:</hi> Such ſparks and notions as this, are uſually called the Light, the Law, or Book of Nature; not that mans nature is the Author of them, but God, as before we have heard. Yet ſo called, Firſt, Becauſe they are imprinted in mans nature. Secondly, Becauſe they are as common as mans nature: and hence it is, that all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do acknowledge a God. Suppoſe the moſt of them pitch upon a falſe god, or ſeek the true God in a falſe way, why yet this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral acknowledgment from the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a mighty Argument that there is a God. And although haply ſome particular perſons have been found to deny this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet thoſe perſons committing hainous and horrible Crimes (but kept ſecret from man) their conſciences afterwards have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed and terrified them: now their hainous Crimes being not knowne to any man but themſelves; why ſhould their conſciences
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119999:11"/>vex and terrifie them, if there were not a God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But may ſome men ſay, in whom the light of nature is almoſt extinguiſhed, I never ſaw God, how can I then believe there is a God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou didſt never ſee thy ſoul, and doſt thou believe therefore thou haſt no ſoul? Thou didſt never ſee the wind, yet ſurely thou believeſt there is ſuch a thing, ſuch a creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object,</hi> 2. But if this be a Truth generally acknowledged, How comes it to paſs, that the moſt men and women live as though there were no God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, by way of Conceſſion or Grant; Secondly, By way of Solution.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of Conceſſion or Grant. It is true, the moſt do live as though there were no God; ſo walk as denying the Preſence, Power, and Juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of Solution or Satisfaction. Although men and women generally by the light of Nature do acknowledg a God, yet through the corruption of nature, they frame and fain him to themſelves, to be ſuch a one as they pleaſe; to wit, without Attributes, not preſent in all places, not infinitely power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:119999:12"/>
                  <p>As this is a Truth, That by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we know and believe there is a God: ſo likewiſe this is a Truth, That ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, by the corruption of nature (in regard of the true God) we are all Atheiſts: Thus the Pſalmiſt, deſcribing the natural man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, There is no God:</hi> The natural man confeſſeth there is a God, but it is a God of his own framing; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Attributes, to wit, an Idol; which upon the matter, is as much as to deny the true God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Although this be a Truth granted, and plain; why yet the Regenerate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have doubtings this way, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doubt Whether there be a God or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And this comes to paſs, Firſt, by Satans ſuggeſtion, who ſometimes darts this thought maliciouſly into them, even in their beſt Devotions. Secondly, this thought may be in them through the corruption of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; they having a ſeed and ſome degrees of Atheiſm remaining in them ſo long as they are in this world. Thirdly, Want of through conſideration may occaſion doubting this way. As when they obſerve themſelves men and women of affliction, and the wicked great in the world, and highly exalted; looking meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this and no further, may occaſion them to queſtion this great Truth; but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119999:12"/>on to the end and iſſue, the doubt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently removed, conſidering what the wicked's exultation ends in; and ſo conſidering what is the iſſue of the godly mans afflictions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To expoſtulate with the wicked and unregenerate: There is a God; this thou ſayeſt, thou beleeveſt; I ſay, thou doſt well, but the divels do as much, nay more; <hi>

                        </gap>hey beleeve and tremble. Jam.</hi> 2.19. Examine thy ſelf, do not they exceed thee in this? Thou believeſt there is a God, but doſt thou tremble at his Juſtice, Power, and Omnipreſence? Doſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thy ſelf of his <hi>Omnipreſence,</hi> that he ſees thy waies, courſes, and proceedings in all places, and at all times? How comes it to paſſe then, that thou willingly and willfully committeſt that ſin in ſecret (in his ſight) which thou wouldeſt be aſhamed to commit in the eye and veiw of the world? Obſerve now; Thou beleeveſt there is a God, but it is a god of thy own framing; a god that ſees not thy ſinfull courſes, and proceedings. And to this purpoſe, take notice how the ſpirit of God brings in the wicked or naturall man, ſpeaking in his heart, <hi>Job</hi> 22.13, 14. <hi>And thou ſayeſt, how doth God know? and is there knowledg in the moſt high?</hi> Pſal. 73.11. <hi>Can he judg tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the dark cloud? thick clouds are a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him, that he ſeeth not.</hi> And Pſal.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119999:13"/>94.7. <hi>They ſay, the Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of Jacob regard it.</hi> Thus what the wicked mans thoughts are of God, his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions declare. And ſo in regard of Gods <hi>Juſtice,</hi> if thou didſt beleeve him to be a God of juſtice, how durſt thou go on obſtinately in thy ſins, <hi>making a covenant with death,</hi> and <hi>being at agreement with hell;</hi> he having openly proclaimed in his word, that he wil be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on al ſuch malefactors? The truth of it is, although thou doſt acknowledg a God, why yet again thou denieſt him, by denying his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; as if he were a God all of mercy: but ſuch as thou, ſhall one day find him to be a God of juſtice, of infinite juſtice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Again, in regard of Gods <hi>Power;</hi> Thou beleeveſt there is a God, but again denieſt him, in that thou doſt not believe him to be a God of infinite power: If thou doſt beleeve him to be a God of infinite power, why doſt not thou rather tremble at his threatning, then at the threatning of a mortal man? Let an earthly Magiſtrate, or Prince threaten, and menace for the breach of his ſtatutes, and edicts, preſently men and women begin to tremble, and to be afraid, and know not which way to turn themſelves; but let the Lord, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God of heaven and earth threaten to bring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119999:13"/>this and that plague, this and that judgment upon them for their ſins and tranſgreſſions; nay even to damn them to the pit of hell, if they do not reform: for all this, they go on ſtill in their ſins, and evill courſes, as though the Lord had not power to maintain his threatnings upon them. Well, thou that art a wicked and ungodly liver, ſee thy condition to be a wofull condition: there is juſt ſo much light in thee, as to make thee inexcuſable: Thou beleeveſt there is a God, but in life denieſt his preſence, power, and juſtice: Thou art not an abſolute Athieſt in judgment, but an Athieſt in practice. Wel, it is as thou thinkeſt, there is a God; but thou ſhalt find him otherwiſe then thou thinkeſt, to wit, all-ſaving; for he is infinitely juſt, and powerfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For <hi>Direction:</hi> Thou beleeveſt there is a God. Firſt, more and more examine this great truth, more and more ponder and perpend it, untill thy heart be eſtabliſhed in it; and <hi>if God be God, ſerve him; if Baal be God, follow him.</hi> The meaning is, if this principle be not true, follow the waies of thy own heart, live and walk according to thy own luſt without any reſtraint; but if it be true, (as it is undoubtedly) then walk and live as throughly beleeving this principle. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119999:14"/>to pleaſe God, to glorifie him, and to have communion with him; and know there is nothing doth ſo choak and ſuffocate this Principle, as a wicked and profane life, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> This is the firſt rule of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou believing this Principle, endeavor to nouriſh and maintain it: To this purpoſe thou maieſt help thy ſelf by the Book of the Creatures, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament ſheweth his handy-work.</hi> There is not the leaſt Creature but thou mayeſt read God in it; but eſpecially be thou exerciſed in the book of the Scriptures in reading and hearing them; they do the moſt plainly and evidently ſet forth God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If thou haſt not a Juſtifying faith, be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with the Lord for it, becauſe without this ſupernatural faith, thou canſt not believe this Principle ſavingly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Converſe much with thoſe that are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They that converſe with the worldly-minded, ſhall obſerve them much to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the event of things to natural and ſecond cauſes; but the godly, the event of things to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119999:14"/>God. Then further, The godly have an experimental knowledg of God, and ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, they many times ſpeak empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and movingly, much to the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the faith of others. A Reverend Light in this age, one <hi>Junius,</hi> doth acknowledg, that the firſt thing that turned him from his Atheiſm, was his talking with a Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his, and his manner of expreſſing himſelf.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Is there a God? why then the ſoul is immortal; for as the immortal ſoul is the image of God, and ſo doth demonſtrate a God: ſo they that do moſt firmly believe there is a God, do likewiſe firmly believe the immortality of the ſoul. And upon that ground caſt for it accordingly, for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and well being of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there be a God? why then, there is a Heaven and a Hell: a place of Bliſs for the godly after this life, and a place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the wicked; otherwiſe God ſhould not be juſt, and then not God. We read of a Pope that when he was on his death-bed, ſaid, He ſhould ere long be reſolved of three
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119999:15"/>things, which all his life long he had doubted of: 1. Whether there be a God or no? 2. Whether the ſoul be immortal, or no? 3.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119999:23"/>mind, he takes it and daſhes it againſt the walls: ſo will the Lord deal with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who will by no means be brought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Creator. But for thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Creator, and truly fear him, he will be found a faithfull Creator to them upon all occaſions; in their greateſt wants, inward, and outward, ſupplying them as ſhall be the beſt; in their greateſt dangers defending them, as ſhall be for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good. <hi>But ye have not looked</hi> (ſaith the Prophet Eſay) <hi>unto the maker thereof, neither had reſpect unto him that faſhioned it long agoe, Iſa.</hi> 22.11. As though if the Jewes had had <hi>[reſpect]</hi> or recourſe unto their Creator in the way of true humiliation and information, as well as uſed the civill means which they were earneſt in, they ſhould have been ſtrong enough, and too ſtrong for the <hi>Perſians</hi> their enemies: ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.8.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. For <hi>Exhortation:</hi> and that divers waies. 1. To imitate God, that we would not hoard up and keep to our ſelves what might be profitable to others. The Lord, although he made all things for his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet his glory was not increaſed by any thing he made: For to ſpeak properly, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies infinitely glorious, his glory can neither be increaſed, nor decreaſed: But in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119999:23"/>the work of Creation, he commnicated himſelf to Elect Angels and men for their good and happineſſe; ſo muſt we bring forth our talent inward and outward, for the good and benefit of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To exhort us, That we would ſeriouſly conſider the work of Creation, and in it to read God and his attributes. There is not the leaſt fly, but in it we may read God and his Attributes; the Lord could have made the world in a moment of time, but takes ſix daies to the buſineſs, and no queſtion to move us to be the more ſerious and laborious in the reveiw of this work: and wil not take it wel at our hand to have ſuch a work as this ſlighted. We muſt ariſe from the creature to the Creator. The unreaſonable creatures are matter of praiſe, and we muſt therefore in our kind be inſtruments of praiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To exhort us to ſerve and obey God, and that with chearfulneſſe; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember thy Creator, in the days of thy youth.</hi> Words of knowledg in Scripture imply affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and practiſe: that is to ſay, know, fear, love, ſerve, and obey thy Creator in the daies of thy youth, thou wilt then be the fitter to ſerve and obey him in thy old age. And ſo the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.2, 3. <hi>Serve the Lord with gladneſſe: it is he that made us and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119999:24"/>not we our ſelves.</hi> We count him a Monſter of men that is very undutiful unto his Parents; but how much more may we account him a Monſter that delights in rebellion againſt his Creator, whoſe inſtruments only our Parents were to bring us into this world? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. For <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> Further to enquire into two Creatures the chief of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, Angels and Men.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Angels, if you ask when they were created? I anſwer, Whithin the compaſs of the firſt ſix dayes, in likelihood upon the firſt day, when the third heaven was created. That they were created within the compaſs of the ſix days, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. and 2.1: <hi>The heavens and the earth were finiſhed and all the hoſt of them.</hi> 2. If you enquire into their nature? <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are inviſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Subſtances, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14 <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits?</hi> 3. If you enquire into their number? <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are very many <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>An innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi> and ſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him.</hi> 4. If
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119999:24"/>we enquire into their Properties? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They are Creatures of excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and underſtanding: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Though I ſpeak with the tongue of men and of Angels:</hi> not that the Angels have tongues, or uſe of ſpeech, but to note what grace and excellency of ſpeech muſt needs be thought to be in them, if it might be ſuppoſed that they ſhould ſpeak; and hence it is they are ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.6. to be <hi>full of eyes.</hi> 2. They are Creatures wonderous holy; I mean, the Angels that fell are extremely wicked, but were created holy. That the Angels we ſpeak of are holy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9.26. They having this ſtile given them, <hi>[Holy]</hi> in both places. 3. They are Creatures of great ſtrength and might, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, yee his Angels, that excel in ſtrength.</hi> And ſo 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Mighty Angels.</hi> 4. They are Creatures very expeditious and nimble, and therefore deſcribed <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.6. <hi>to have wings.</hi> 5. They are Creatures Immortal: <hi>Luke</hi> 20.36. <hi>Neither can they dye any more, for they are equal unto the Angels:</hi> yet but Creatures for all this, and finite. Laſtly, If you ask, Why they were created? <hi>Anſw.</hi> For theſe two ends eſpecially: 1. To cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the praiſes of God: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Bleſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119999:25"/>the Lord, yee his Angels;</hi> and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.3. <hi>One cryed unto another, and ſaid, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> 2. To be inſtruments of good and ſafety unto Elect men and women: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7 <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them:</hi> Pſal. 91.11. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee to keep thee in thy wayes;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> As this may greatly comfort and animate all true Believers, why ſo it may reſtrain and pull in the wicked from offering the leaſt wrong unto ſuch. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones; for I ſay unto you, that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> They are Angels to take revenge upon you, if you do them the leaſt wrong; which is evident by the Angel his ſtanding with a <hi>drawn ſword</hi> ready to <hi>deſtroy Balaam,</hi> becauſe he would be allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by worldly gain to go againſt Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Num.</hi> 22.22 &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the other principal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to wit, <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ask when he was created? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Upon the ſixth day, and ſo the woman; <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27.31. 2. If you ask of what was man made?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119999:25"/>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> His body was of the duſt of the earth, the womans body of one of the mans ribs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. and 2.22. both their ſouls of nothing, inſpired of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. In man we have an Epitome or <hi>compendium</hi> of all Creatures, he being partly viſible, and partly inviſible: Viſible in regard of his body; Inviſible in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſoul. And touching the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of man as he was created, this is implyed in that the Trinity hold a conſultation about him: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make man,</hi> &amp;c. Now mans excellency as he was created, did eſpecially conſiſt in three things: 1. In that he was made according to Gods image: Gen. 1.27. <hi>So God created man in his own Image, in the Image of God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he him.</hi> Now by the Image of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, we are to underſtand; 1. His Immaterial, Inviſible, and Immortal ſoul; for ſo every man is the Image of God, in regard of the ſubſtance of his ſoul. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth mans bloud, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed; for in the Image of God made he man.</hi> By the Image of God in this place, we only underſtand the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſoul. 2. <hi>Adam</hi> was created ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Image in regard of <hi>Holineſs and Righteouſneſs:</hi> he is ſaid to be created according to Gods Image, becauſe he was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119999:26"/>created a holy and righteous Creature. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>And that ye put on that new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing wherein mans excellency did conſiſt, as he was created, was in this, That he had ſweet communion and fellowſhip with God. This may be gathered from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19. <hi>And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beaſt of the field, and every foul of the aire, and brought them unto Adam to ſee what he would call them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing wherein mans excellency did conſiſt as he was created, was, he was made Lord of all viſible Creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make man in our own image, after our likeneſs, and let them have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the foul of the aire, and over the cattel, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth:</hi> And ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 28. God ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, Have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the foul of the aire, and over e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very living thing that moveth upon the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus far touching the work of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> We come in the next place to the work of <hi>Preſervation.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="member">

                  <head>MEMBER IV. <hi>Preſerver and Governor of all things.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>THe one true God, the Lord is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver and Governor of all things:</hi> For ſo we muſt underſtand the Catechiſm, when it ſaith, the Lord is Governor of all things: the former to be implied, to wit, that he is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver as wel as the Governor of all things. And ſo we come from the work of <hi>Creation</hi> unto the work of Gods <hi>Providence;</hi> which conſiſts of theſe two parts, <hi>Preſervation</hi> and <hi>Guberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or governing. And what is <hi>Preſervation</hi> but Creation continued, or the upholding of all creatures in their kinds, beings, motions and operations? And what is <hi>Gubernation</hi> but the moving, ordering and directing of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and their actions to their decreed ends?</p>
                  <p>Now that the Lord is the Preſerver and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of all things, the Scripture is very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous this way; but we wil only produce three or four places: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. the Apoſtle deſcribes the Lord to be ſuch a one <hi>as worketh all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſel of his own wil:</hi> and the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 36.6. <hi>O Lord, thou preſerveſt man and beaſt.</hi> Act. 17.28. <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being:</hi> And do but ſee <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Thou preſerveſt them all</hi> (to wit, all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) <hi>and the Hoſt of Heaven worſhipeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119999:27"/>thee:</hi> that is to ſay, is governed by thee, is at thy command and appointment. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to argue the point in hand. That the Lord doth preſerve and uphold all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their kinds, beings, motions, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is evident and plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1 Otherwiſe they would not continue, but would return to their firſt nothing, to that nothing of which they were at first made. The Lord is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> not only becauſe he gave being to every thing, but likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he maintained it in every thing. And that the Lord is Governor of all things, to wit, moveth, directeth, and diſpoſeth of all the Creatures and their actions to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed ends, this we demonſtrate two wayes; 1. By inſtancing particular Creatures. 2. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2 As firſt, The <hi>good Angels:</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 21.15. <hi>And God ſent an Angel unto Jeruſalem to deſtroy it, and as he was deſtroying, he ſaid to the Angel that deſtroyed, It is enough, ſtay now thy hand.</hi> And ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 1.26. <hi>And in the ſixth month the Angel Gabriel was ſent from God unto a City of Galilee named Nazareth.</hi> 2. The <hi>evil angels:</hi> The Divels are governed by God and act his command. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.22. <hi>The Lord ſaith unto the lying ſpirit, go forth;</hi> and in <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Michajah ſaith to Ahab, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119999:27"/>the Lord hath put a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all theſe thy Prophets:</hi> And ſo in <hi>Mark</hi> 9.26. <hi>And the ſpirit cryed, and rent him ſore, and came out of him;</hi> but in the verſe next foregoing, God-man layes a command upon this wicked ſpirit, <hi>Thou dumb and deaf ſpirit, I charge thee come out of him, and enter no more into him.</hi> 3. <hi>Men and Women,</hi> the Lord governeth and diſpoſeth of them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it whitherſoever he will.</hi> And ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.26. <hi>Many ſeek the Rulers favor, but every mans judgment cometh from the Lord.</hi> And if thoſe ſuperior creatures (<hi>Job</hi> 12.17. to 22.) be at Gods command and governed by him; why then ſure all the inferior creatures alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But may ſome men ſay, If the Lord ſo command and govern the reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is not the freedom of their wils by this altogether taken away?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> No; becauſe the Lord doth not compel the reaſonable Creatures to do this or that, but only bends and inclines them. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Gods will, doth not overthrow the freedom of their wills: This or that action, if it be referred to Gods will, may be ſaid to be neceſſary; if to their wills, it may be ſaid to be voluntary.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:119999:28"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The ſecond way whereby we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that the Lord is the governor of all things, is by inſtancing particular actions. If the providence of God doth extend, 1. Even to the leaſt actions, to actions of the ſmalleſt nature. 2. To actions that are the moſt caſual. 3. To acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are the moſt ſinful; why then the Lord is governor of all things. But that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God doth extend to actions of all theſe kinds, the Scriptures do plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. 1. That the providence of God extends to the leaſt actions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29, 30. <hi>Are not two ſparrows ſold for a farthing? and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your father; the very hairs of your head are all numbred:</hi> can there be any thing of leſs account then a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row lighting on the ground, or an hair falling from our head? Secondly, that the providence of God doth extend even to actions that are the moſt caſual: <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.33. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord:</hi> what more caſuall then the event of lots caſt into the lap? Thirdly, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God doth extend to actions that are moſt ſinfull. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. <hi>If the Prophet be deceived when he hath ſpoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that Prophet:</hi> was there ever a more wicked action undertaken then crucifying of Chriſt? and yet ſee what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119999:28"/>affirms of them who did commit this fact, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27, 28. <hi>They were gathered together for to do whatſoever thy hand</hi> (ſpeaking of God) <hi>and thy counſell determined before to be done.</hi> Not that the Lord is the Author of ſin, as it is ſin; but the Author of the action as it is an action; he permits the ſin, and not only as an idle ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator, but further works in the ſinfull action; as 1. By taking away or denying his grace, 2. By delivering over the party unto Satan and his own luſts. 3. By preſenting unto the party ſuch objects, as through corruption may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſin. 4. By ſo governing the ſinfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as to diſpoſe it to his own glory. And thus we ſee it evidently argued, that the Lord is the preſerver and governor of all things: Now we come 1. To lay forth the kinds of Gods providence. 2. To anſwer ſome objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. To the Uſe.</p>
                  <list>
                     <head>Kinds of Gods providence.</head>
                     <item>1. The Providence of God is either <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> or <hi>immediate;</hi> the <hi>immediate</hi> Providence of God is, 1. When he works without means.</item>
                     <item>2. When he makes void the means. Or</item>
                     <item>3. When he works contrary to the means.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. Without means, as when he ſuſtained <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mount 40 daies and 40 nights without either bread or water, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.28. 2. Making void the means; for thus he doth ſometimes. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11. <hi>I returned and ſaw under the Sun,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119999:29"/>that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the bat tel to the ſtrong, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Contrary to the means, as when the Lord brought water out of the rock, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.6. Thus for the immediate Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God: The mediate providence of God is, when he worketh by means; and this is his moſt uſual working: Now the Lord doth not uſe means becauſe of any defect or inability in himſelf; but 1. That he might communicate ſome honor to the creature, he is pleaſed to make uſe thereof. 2. That the creature might ſo better perceive his working, his providence, the working of his providence. 3. That he might ſo ſhew himſelf to be Lord of al things, making uſe of them as he pleaſeth. And 4. leſt under pretence of his providence, we ſhould be ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But that you may better underſtand the thing in hand, to wit, Gods providence, we come to lay it forth in another diviſion: as, the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, Particular, or Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar.</hi> The <hi>univerſal providence</hi> of God, is that whereby he preſerves, and governs all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures according to that naturall inſtinct he put into every ſeveral kind in the firſt creation, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11. <hi>And God ſaid, Let the earth bring forth graſs, the herb yeilding ſeed, and the fruit tree yeilding fruit after his kind:</hi> This is the law of nature, or order which the Lord appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſet in the beginning, and accordingly (in the ordinary courſe) the creatures work:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119999:29"/>This we call Gods <hi>univerſall providence.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The <hi>peculiar Providence</hi> of God, is that which he exerciſeth towards his Church and choſen, gathering them, guiding them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them; he working in them, by them, and for them peculiarly; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18. <hi>Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the bodies of men, he ſtiles the Lord, <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all men, chiefly</hi> (for ſo it is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal) <hi>of thoſe that believe.</hi> This is Gods <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Providence:</hi> And thus much for this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the <hi>kinds</hi> of Gods Providence.</p>

                  <p>THat there is a diſtinction of Perſons, and this diſtinction in the Divine Eſſence, is evident, if ſo be we look into the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make man in our image;</hi> where God the Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults with his Son, and holy Spirit.

How the Divine Eſſence, and the Perſons in the Divine Eſſence do differ? 2. What the Perſon of the Father is? what the Perſon of the Son is? and what the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt is? 3. How theſe three Perſons are united? 4. How they are diſtinguiſhed? 5. Why it is neceſſary the Church ſhould be acquainted with this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? And Laſtly the Uſes.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. How the Divine Eſſence, and the Perſons in the Divine Eſſence do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The difference is not real, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; we muſt not conceive the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to be one thing, and the Perſons to be another thing; for that were not to make a Trinity, but a Quaternity; not to make three, but four. There is another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Godhead; but not another thing, and another thing. That there is another, and another in the Godhead, <hi>John</hi> 5.32. <hi>There is another that beareth witneſs of me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour; to wit, the Father: And <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. <hi>And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, even the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth;</hi> but not another thing, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing; for this were to divide the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and to make three Gods; the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head being undivided, and there being but one God, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. <hi>There is none other God but one:</hi> the Divine Eſſence is one, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the three Perſons; the Perſons are three ſeveral Subſiſtences, or manners of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that one Eſſence: It is true, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God; and all Eternal, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp;c: But yet there are not three Gods, three Eternals, three Omnipotents;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119999:34"/>becauſe the Eſſence, the whole Eſſence, the Godhead, the whole Godhead, is in every one of the three Perſons, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In him</hi> (to wit in the Son) <hi>dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead bodily,</hi> that is, Perſonally, in the Perſon of the Son, which is true of the other two Perſons. And this is the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Myſteries, that the Eſſence or Godhead ſhould be in every Perſon, and yet not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; that the whole Eſſence or Godhead ſhould be in every Perſon, and yet not three Gods, but one God. Now we come to the ſecond queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What the Perſon of the Father is? what the Perſon of the Son is? and what the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Father is the firſt perſon, the Son is the ſecond, and the Holy Ghoſt is the third. The Father is not the firſt perſon in regard of time or Dignity, but in regard of Order, all the perſons being as Co-Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, ſo Co-Eternal, and Co-Equal. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the perſons obſerved, there is no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, or Poſteriority, no Superiority, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority among them: the Father is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not begotten, nor proceeding, but from everlaſting begetting the Son, and ſending forth the Holy Ghoſt: The Son is the perſon not Created, but begotten from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119999:35"/>everlaſting of the Father, and with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſending forth the Holy Ghoſt. The Holy Ghoſt is the perſon not made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, by an Eternal ſpiration. Now here we muſt obſerve, that the Eſſence doth not beget another Eſſence; for every one of the perſons hath the Eſſence from himſelf, but one perſon doth beget another, the perſon of the Father, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sonne. 2. That there is this difference betwixt the Sonne and the Holy Ghoſt, The Sonne is begotten of the Father onely, the Holy Ghoſt proceeds both from the Father and the Sonne. 3. Theſe phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes begetting, begotten, proceeding, muſt in no caſe be underſtood in any carnal way, but altogether in a Spiritual manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. How theſe three perſons are united?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The union of the perſons is that, by which each one is in the reſt, and with the reſt, by reaſon of the unity of the Eſſence or Godhead, as <hi>John</hi> 14.10. <hi>Believeſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to <hi>Philip?</hi> They are all one in nature, that is, Co-Eſſential, and Con-Subſtantial; as 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119999:35"/>one;</hi> to wit, in Nature and Eſſence. That which we ſaid before, is true; the Father is God, the Sonne is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God; yet there are not three Gods, but one God onely; becauſe there is but one Divine Eſſence, but one God, and no more in Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. How the three perſons are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not Eſſentially, for every one of them hath the whole Eſſence or Godhead; and yet really. And here obſerve, The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Eſſence and the perſons is but formal, the difference betwixt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelves is real; as the Father is the Father, and not the Son, or the Holy Ghoſt; The Son is the Son, and not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor the Holy Ghoſt; The Holy Ghoſt is the Holy Ghoſt, and not the Father, nor the Son.</p>
                  <p>Now the perſons of the Godhead are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed two wayes: 1. By their <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> actions, 2. By their <hi>Internal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>External</hi> actions are ſuch, as they work in and toward the creatures, as in the work of Creation, and Preſervation, &amp;c: As touching any of theſe works or actions, the Father worketh of himſelf, by the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt; the Sonne from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119999:36"/>by the Holy Ghoſt; the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son. The Father is the Original or Fountain of actions, effecting by the Son and the Holy Ghoſt: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per working of the Son, is to execute acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Father, by the Holy Ghoſt: the proper working of the Holy Ghoſt, is from the Father and the Son, to finiſh actions. And here obſerve the reaſon why in Scripture ſo many things are attributed and refered to the Father; Becauſe he is, as the Original and Fountain of the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo likewiſe of their operations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The perſons of the Godhead are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by their <hi>Internal</hi> actions; and theſe are ſuch, as they exerciſe one towards another: As the incommunicable property of the Father is to <hi>beget;</hi> the incommunicable property of the Son is to be <hi>begotten;</hi> and the incommunicable property of the Holy Ghoſt is to <hi>proceed.</hi> And thus in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we ſee into this great Myſterie, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5 Why it is neceſſary the Church ſhould be acquainted with this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In reſpect of <hi>Gods glory,</hi> that ſo he may be diſcerned, and diſtinguiſhed from all falſe gods, and Idols. 2. In regard
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119999:36"/>of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and that two wayes. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Original ſin is ſo called, firſt, becauſe it was from the beginning; I mean, as ſoon as ever the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe it is the beginning of all actual ſin. Now Original ſin is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Largely, ſometimes Strictly. When it is taken Largely, it ſignifies the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the guilt following, and withal the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature. When it is taken Strictly, it ſignifies that corruption which taints and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files the whole man, every faculty of ſoul and member of body. More plainly, Original ſin taken ſtrictly, contains, 1 A want of all holy diſpoſition in every faculty of ſoul and member of body. 2. In ſtead and room thereof, a corrupt diſpoſition in every faculty of ſoul and member of body. And thus now ſeeing what Original ſin is, we come to prove that the natures of the unregenerate are wholly corrupted with it. To this purpoſe</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take notice of ſome general phraſes which the Spirit of God uſeth touching Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin, as the natural man is tainted with it and defiled. As ſometimes it is called the <hi>Old man,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.9. Sometimes it is called the <hi>Fleſh, Rom.</hi> 7.5, 18. and ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 25. Sometimes it is called the <hi>members,</hi> as <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5: Sometimes it is called the <hi>Law of the members,</hi> Rom. 7.23. Sometimes the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.6. and 7.24. And what do
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119999:43"/>all theſe generall phraſes imply, and import, but that the natures of the unregenerate are wholly corrupted with originall ſin? But in the ſecond place, that you may be the more throughly convinced in the point, we wil ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize and take man in peeces, and let you ſee what the ſpirit of God ſaith of every ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part and peece; to wit, how that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faculty of ſoul, and member of body, there is not only want of all holy diſpoſition, but likewiſe a corrupt and depraved diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the ſoul, we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe faculties, 1. The <hi>Mind,</hi> 2. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> 3. The <hi>Conſcience.</hi> 4. The <hi>Will.</hi> 5. The <hi>Affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Mind,</hi> that it is not only empty of all holy knowledg, but depraved with a corrupt diſpoſition. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>The imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans heart</hi> (that is to ſay, of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mans mind) <hi>is evil from his youth;</hi> from that very time he begins firſt to conceive. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only affirm 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 14. That the <hi>natural man cannot know the things of the Spirit of God;</hi> But <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. he ſaith, the unbeleeving, <hi>the naturall mind is de filed;</hi> nay <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. That the <hi>carnall,</hi> the natural <hi>mind is enmity againſt God:</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the <hi>Epheſians, Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119999:44"/>in the ſpirit of your mind,</hi> intimates that that which is moſt inward in the naturall mind, which is as it were the mind of the mind, is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the <hi>memory,</hi> that it is not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all holy abilities, but depraved with a corrupt diſpoſition, <hi>Gen</hi> 40.23. <hi>yet did not the chief Butler remember Joſeph, but forgate him. Deut.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God,</hi> which naturally (as though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſhould ſay) thou art prone unto. <hi>The chief Preiſts and Phariſees ſaid to Pilate,</hi> Matth. 27.63. <hi>Sir, we remember that that deceiver</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt) <hi>ſaid whilſt he was yet alive, after three daies I will riſe again:</hi> They could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what our Saviour had ſaid whilſt he was yet alive in that kind, to their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ends; the naturall memory is a corrupt memory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>natural conſcience</hi> is not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of holy teſtimonies, but is likewiſe corrupted, and defiled. <hi>Titus</hi> 1 15. <hi>But even their mind and conſcience is defiled;</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking of unbeleevers, and thoſe in the eſtate of nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>naturall will</hi> is not only deprived of all freedome to good, but likewiſe depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a corrupt diſpoſition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119999:44"/>are of the Spirit of God,</hi> Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you,</hi> to wit, by his Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace; <hi>both to will, and to do of his good pleaſure:</hi> nay, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12. ſay the Jews, <hi>we will walk after our own devices, and we will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one do the imagination of his evill heart.</hi> The naturall will is a corrupt will.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>affections</hi> are not only deprived of all holy motion, but exceeding corrupt, and diſordered. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts;</hi> as though the affections naturally were corrupt and diſordered; and ſo the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle terms them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. The affections of ſin, or <hi>ſinful affections:</hi> and this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes very evident; in deſcribing natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men and women, he ſtiles them <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, Rom.</hi> 1.30. And thus we ſee by holy writ, that every facultie of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons ſoul is corrupted, and depraved with originall ſin. Now come we briefly to the <hi>members of his body,</hi> and we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them to be corrupted with originall ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>eye,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Having eyes full of adultery:</hi> the naturall eye is a filthy and an unclean eye. Secondly The <hi>ear,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Having itching ears;</hi> the naturall eare is an itching ear. Thirdly The <hi>tongue, Jam.</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:119999:45"/>3.6. <hi>The tongue is a ſire, a world of iniquity,</hi> The natural tongue is a corrupt tongue. 4. The <hi>hand Iſai.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Your hands are full of bloud:</hi> The natural hand is a cruel hand. 5. The <hi>feet:</hi> The Apoſtle deſcribing men and women in the eſtate of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.15 <hi>Their feet are ſwift to ſhed bloud,</hi> ſaith he: The natural feet are ſwift to miſchief. Thoſe outward ſenſes and members are not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all holy inclination, but prone to let in ſin, and to execute ſin. And thus now by Anatomizing, and taking man in pieces, we have it made evident, that the natures of all the unregenerate are <hi>wholly corrupted with Original ſin,</hi> which indeed is the ſeed and ſpawn of all ſin, even of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. But here we muſt remember, that the nature it ſelf is good, but the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature is evil. Theſe two in the natural man may be diſtinguiſhed, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated: the one is not the other, but the one is not without the other. Hence it is that Original ſin is called <hi>the ſin that doth ſo encompaſſe us,</hi> or that hangs ſo faſt on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond Member of the Aſſertion, to manifeſt that the natural mans life is wholly corrupted with actual tranſgreſſion. And muſt it not needs be ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119999:45"/>when his nature is corrupted, as aforeſaid? What can ſuch a tree bring forth, but even fruit ſutable? and that it is ſo, do but ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> when he and they were in the ſtate of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>For when we were in the fleſh,</hi> (to wit, in the ſtate of nature) <hi>the motions of ſin,</hi> (or the affections of ſin or ſinful affections) <hi>which were by the Law,</hi> (to wit, ſtirred up by the Law) <hi>did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death;</hi> to wit, actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. And the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12 deſcribing of men and women in the eſtate of nature: <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> If there be no natural man that doth any good, why then ſurely every natural man doth nothing but what is evil; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is true in regard of good formally, any thing which is acceptable to God: and if the natural man doth any thing which is good materially, it is not as he is a natural man, but as he is helped and aſſiſted by common Grace.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould now come to lay forth the parts of actual tranſgreſſion, as ſin of Omiſſion, and ſin of Commiſſion, and the ſeverall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions and degrees; but ſo we ſhould be more prolix then we purpoſed in this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119999:46"/>Expoſition; and therefore we proceed to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To confute the Papiſts, who ſpeak of a freedom in the natural will to good, if it be but a little helped and aſſiſted. As though there were ſome power remaining in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral will this way. But this is juſt to oppoſe the judgment of Gods Spirit; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And you hath he quickned who were dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes.</hi> No more power in a natural will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thing that is acceptable unto God, then in a dead man to ſtir and walk about. And further, can there be any more in the will then in the mind? There is no holy knowledg in the natural mind, but even the <hi>wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity to God;</hi> and the ſpirit of the mind, even the mind of the mind, depraved and corrupted: And can there then be any holy diſpoſition in the natural will? And thus the Apoſtle argues 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, neither can he know them.</hi> The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man is ſo far from having any holy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in his will, as he hath none in his mind; and if no holy diſpoſition in his mind, why then ſure none in his will.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:119999:46"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. To reprove divers perſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as are forward to boaſt of their Birth, Parentage, and Pedigree. A poor thing to boaſt of, when their lives are wholly corrupted with actual tranſgreſſion, and their natures with Original corruption. <hi>David</hi> conſidering of his Birth and Conception, was humbled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> Lumps of ſin to be lifted up becauſe of a little civil difference, not conſidering their natural pravity and vileneſ!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To reprove ſuch as ſtand upon their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wit and wiſdom, neglecting and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the means of holy wiſdom: but let ſuch ſee the little extent of their natural wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To reprove ſuch as are ſo far from being humbled for their natural corruption, as they leſſen and excuſe their actual tranſgreſſions by it. Tell them of their Uncleanneſs, of their Drunkenneſs. of their Covetouſneſs, of their Impatience, &amp;c. They preſently anſwer, and that careleſly, It is their nature, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it: or thus, They are but fleſh and blood, and what would we have them to do? And thus they bolſter up Actual Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119999:47"/>by Original Corruption, and are humbled for neither, where they ſhould be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Further to awaken the natural man. He never did good in all his life (I mean any thing acceptable to God); ſuppoſe he be thirty, forty, threeſcore years old: then what hath he done but ſin? All his actions Natural, Civil, Religious, are ſin: as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the evil ends propounded; why ſo, likewiſe in regard of the evil fountain they iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued from. And in this eſtate he cannot be ſaved. John 3.3. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And ſuppoſe as yet ſome natural peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have not broken forth into ſuch groſs ſins as ſome others have; why yet the ſeeds of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin remaine in them unmortified, and may manifeſt themſelves in their lives to night before to morrow, for any thing they know, or any power they have over them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. To direct every one of us that in the practice of repentance, we would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour to mourn for Actual Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but likewiſe for Original corruption, even for our bad natures. Although Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doth commonly begin at ſome great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ſin; why yet, let every Actual ſin lead
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119999:47"/>us to mourn for Original ſin: it being not only the puniſhment of ſin, but ſin it ſelf, and the cauſe of all actual ſin. This is a main difference betwixt the ſincere and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. The ſincere perſon doth not only mourn for actual Tranſgreſſions, but likewiſe for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Corruptions, as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> And ſo further, he doth not only labour to prevent actual Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but likewiſe to ſuppreſs Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Even as <hi>Sarah</hi> will not have <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> be packing, but his mother the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman likewiſe: Or as <hi>Eliſha</hi> healed the bitter waters by ſeaſoning them at the Spring, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.21. The ſincere man or woman doth not only ſtrive to reform the <hi>action,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>affection</hi> of ſinning.</p>

                  <p>Now for the opening of this Point, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound theſe queſtions. 1. What <hi>Adams</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was before this Fall? 2. The cauſe of his Fall. 3. The fall it ſelf. 4. How his whole Poſterity became wholly corrupted with ſin by his fall.</p>

                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. What <hi>Adams</hi> condition was before his fall?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are to know, that <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1 <hi>Holy:</hi> 2. <hi>Happy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Holy.</hi> He did not only know God, and his will, perfectly, as far as ſuch a creature was capable; but likewiſe there was in every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ſoul, and member of his body, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſition, a holy conformity unto God and his will: And ſo we are to underſtand theſe places, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make man in our image, after our likeneſs: So God created man in his own [likeneſs]</hi> or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, <hi>in the image of God created he him.</hi> And <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledg, after the image

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Happy.</hi> The Lord did create him happy: as firſt, Being placed in the <hi>Garden of Eden, Gen.</hi> 2.8. A place of ſingular delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therefore called, <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> Our Saviour alluding to heaven by it, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43 ſaith he to the Thief upon the Croſs, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> 2. In ſtate of <hi>Innocency:</hi> he had a bleſſed communion and fellowſhip with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19. <hi>And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beaſt of the field, and every foul of the air, and brought them unto Adam to ſee what he would call them:</hi> This intimates that <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall had ſweet converſe and communion with God. 3. A kind of happineſs was put upon <hi>Adams</hi> body, it being created beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and glorious; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25. <hi>And they were both naked, the man and his wife</hi> (that is to ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve) and were not aſhamed:</hi> Not that any uncomly thing is ſpoken of them, but in this paſſage the Spirit of God would ſet forth the beauty and comlineſs of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, every part and member being ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as they had no cauſe to be aſhamed. It was ſin that brought in deformity and ſhame.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119999:49"/>4. Although <hi>Adam</hi> had a peculiar Calling to walk in, the Garden to dreſs and keep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15. yet he was able to execute it without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pain or wearineſs, as is evident <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, till thou return to the ground;</hi> that is, with pain and wearineſs: but intimating, that before his fall, it was not ſo. Laſtly, He was made Lord and King over all the viſible Creatures. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. ſaith the Lord to <hi>Adam, Have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the foul of the air, and over every living thing that moveth on the earth.</hi> Thus we ſee what <hi>Adams</hi> condition was before his fall: we come to the ſecond Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What were the cauſes of <hi>Adams</hi> fall?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf was the principal cauſe of his own fall, and that by the abuſe of his own free will; he was made mutably, changeably good, as we may perceive by the tenor of Gods Commandment, in which he forbids him to <hi>eat of the tree of knowledg of good and evil,</hi> Gen. 2.17. <hi>Of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye:</hi> intimating his free will to eat or not eat of it; he might have ſtood if he would, or he might fall if he would. It is true, the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119999:49"/>Lord did not give him the gift of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, did not corroborate and confirm him with new grace, neither was the Lord bound unto it. Thus we ſee that <hi>Adams</hi> abuſe of his own free will, was the principal cauſe of his fall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Divel and <hi>Eve,</hi> were furthering cauſes of <hi>Adams</hi> fall: Firſt, I ſay, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel was a furthering cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and that by counſelling and perſwading. He did not compel or enforce the will of <hi>Eve</hi> or of <hi>Adam,</hi> for that he could not do: but not long before having falne himſelf, in hatred to God, and envy to mankind, he wondrous cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and craftily ſets upon this miſchief, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in the ſtory <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. &amp;c. As firſt, take we notice of the Inſtrument he makes choice of, whereby to bring about this wicked Deſign, he ſpeaking in, and by a Serpent; and ſee we how the Spirit of God deſcribes this Creature, Gen. 3.1. <hi>Now the Serpent was more ſubtil then any beaſt of the field which the Lord God had made.</hi> 2.

                  <p>Doct. <hi>EVery one in the eſtate of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Divels ſlave, is the ſlave of the Divel.</hi> This aſſertion the Scripture makes very plain and evident, as <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> being ſent to the unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gentiles, the Lord acquaints him, that his buſineſs unto them was, <hi>to open their eyes, to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God:</hi> intimating, that being in the eſtate of nature, they were the ſlaves of the Divel, under his dominion: and ſo Col. 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs;</hi> that is to ſay, from the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119999:53"/>power of Satan, as though he and the Colloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians had been under Satans dominion, ſo long as they were in the eſtate of nature.

                  <p>The Truth of this Point may be maintained by divers Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Every man, and ſo every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is either Gods ſervant, or the Divels ſlave; but the unregenerate are not Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. It is true they owe God ſervice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but they have no mind, no will unto it; as our Saviour tells the Jewes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee: How often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chicken under wings, and ye would not?</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20. <hi>When ye were the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119999:54"/>ſervants of ſin, ye were free from righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, when ye were in the eſtate of nature, there was not the leaſt deſire or motion in you to holy obedience. And do but try thoſe that are in the eſtate of nature, even with the outward Service of God, as Prayer, reading of the Word, hearing of Sermons, converſing with the Godly, ſanctifying of the Sabbath; O how irkſome and burdenſome are theſe things unto them? you ſeem to kill them when you put theſe things upon them. They cannot, they will not hold to theſe Religious courſes conſtantly; they will find ſome way or other to ſhift themſelves from thoſe (as they hold them) intollerable burdens. And thus we ſee the unregenerate are not Gods ſervants, and therefore it followes that they are the Divels ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Every one in the eſtate of corrupt nature is the ſervant of ſin, and ſo muſt needs be the ſlave of the Divel. Theſe two are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate the one to the other; ſin being the Divels baud or Broker, preferring men and women to his ſervice. Now that every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſon is the ſervant of ſin; do but ſee what our Saviour ſaith. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin;</hi> that is to ſay, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin as the unregenerate, goes on in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119999:54"/>the practice of ſin impenitently; and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>But God be thanked, ye were the ſervants of ſin;</hi> meaning when they were in the eſtate of nature; but when he writ this Epiſtle, taking notice of a change wrought in them, he thanketh God. And ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>When ye were the ſervants of ſin;</hi> which (as though the Apoſtle ſhould ſay) you were when you were in the eſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus we ſee the unregenerate are the ſervants of ſin, and ſo conſequently the ſlaves of the Divel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. The unregenerate, although they owe no ſervice to the Divel, why yet they willingly and readily ſubject themſelves unto him, and obey him, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your father the Divel, and the luſts of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye will do,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the Jews. And hence it is that he calls Satan the Prince of this world, <hi>John</hi> 12.31. and 16.11. And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. <hi>The ruler of the darkneſs of this world;</hi> to wit, of the unregenerate. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The god of this world.</hi> And it is a wonder to behold and obſerve how chearfully the unregenerate ſerve the Divel, yea many times when great difficulty, nay viſible danger is in the way. If he command the Drunkard, he riſeth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning to follow after drunkenneſs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119999:55"/>If he command the Adulterer, he watcheth his opportunities, although never ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient unto the health of his body. If he command the Covetous perſon, he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his worldly project, or elſe it ſhall coſt him his life. Who riſeth ſo early as the Drunkard, and ſits up ſo late? Who walks ſo many dark nights as the Adulterer? Who endures ſo many Tempeſts as the Pirat? Who adventures on ſo many dangers as Theeves and Robbers? Thus we ſee the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are the Divels ſlaves, becauſe of their willing obedience and ſubjection to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. That the unregenerate are the ſlaves of the Divel, is evident by their reward in this life and the life to come. In this life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many outward judgements upon them divers times) terrors of conſcience, and fear of hell fire, as the unregenerate are deſcribed <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. to be ſuch <hi>as through the fear of death</hi> (that is to ſay, death eternal) <hi>are all their life time ſubject to bondage:</hi> And in the life to come, to condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death;</hi> to wit, eternal. And ſo of Satan. He will promiſe great matters to men and women, but he is a Deluder and a Lyar. He told our firſt Parents, obeying him, they ſhould become as gods; but in their woful experience, they found the clean
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119999:55"/>contrary. And ſo he ſuggeſted to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.8, 9. that if he would <hi>fall down and worſhip him,</hi> what he would do for him: but had our Saviour truſted him, he had been deceived. The truth of it is, he deceives all that truſt him: Witneſs his principal ſlaves Witches, and Wizards, unto whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth much Wealth and Riches; but where is the Wealth of ſuch when they dye? Thus we ſee, by the woful reward of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in this life, and the life to come, that they are the ſlaves of the Divel.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. That the unregenerate are the ſlaves of the Divel is plain, becauſe the Lord as the puniſhment of ſin, hath given them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto his dominion and government, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he gave the rebellious Iſraelites of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the hands of cruel Tyrants. We all in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes making choice of this Maſter; rather chuſing to obey Satan then God: was it not juſt with the Lord to give us up unto his Regiment? And ſo the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate continually delighting more in the ſervice of Satan then in the ſervice of God: is it not juſt with God to leave them in his hands, to be ſlaves to him whoſe ſervice they ſo delight in? It is true, Satan hath no power but what Gods permits. But how juſt is it with God to give up ſuch unto his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119999:56"/>dominion as are Rebels to his Majeſty?</p>
                  <p>Now for the further illuſtration of this point we come to anſwer ſome objections. 2 To ſhew the greatneſſe, and grievouſneſſe of this ſlavery; and Laſtly to the Uſes.</p>

The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the regenerate, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But ye are a choſen generation, a royall Prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people.</hi> They are no longer the ſlaves of Satan, but the ſervants of God; nay, <hi>the children of God by adoption.</hi> Theſe Objections being anſwered, we come (in ſome meaſure) to point at the greatneſſe, and grievouſneſs of this ſlavery, the miſerableneſſe of it. You have heard of the bondage of Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Turks, and Infidels, of the ſlavery of the <hi>Gibeointes,</hi> who were cenſured by <hi>Joſhuah</hi> to be <hi>hewers of wood, and drawers of water; Joſh.</hi> 9.23. But eſpecially of the great ſlavery of the Iſraelites under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in Egypt; but this bondage of the unregenerate under Satan, is a great deal worſe. For firſt, that bondage was of the <hi>body only,</hi> but this is the bondage of the whole man, <hi>body and ſoul.</hi> Secondly, In that bondage, <hi>men</hi> were ſerved; but in this, the <hi>Divel</hi> who is the baſeſt Lord,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119999:57"/>and who commands the baſeſt things. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, In that bondage the greateſt harm was <hi>temporal,</hi> but in this <hi>eternal,</hi> even damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in hell for ever. Fourthly, In that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, they had a ſenſe of their thraldome, and deſired liberty; but in this, men do not perceive themſelves to be bound, but think themſelves to be free, and deſpiſe liberty. Laſtly in all outward bondage, there may be probability of help; as by running away, or by intreaty, or by ranſome, or by the death of thoſe that hold us in bondage: but in this bondage men and women lie ſtill, as it were bound hand and foot, not able, not willing to help themſelves, except the Lord from heaven come and vindicate them out of the paws of the Lion, by his Word and Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind them and ſet them free. Now we come to the Uſes.</p>

They ſeem to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the condition of ſuch as live out of the danger of mans Law; have enough to pay every man his own, ſo as they feare not to be caſt in priſon, are able to make their part good in any ſute or quarrel, may go whither they liſt, as their humor ſerves, from Ale-houſe, to Ale-houſe; from Bawdy-houſe, to Bawdy-houſe; have mony enough in their
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119999:58"/>purſes to defray. ſo as they need not go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore. O they take ſuch to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free perſons in the world, and only to live at their own command: and thus they judg, looking upon the outward appearance; in the mean time, not conſidering that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid, being in the eſtate of nature, they are all this while the ſlaves of the Divel. Certain it is, there be many that feed dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are clothed richly, live idly, take their fill of all worldly pleaſures, in all licenciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and yet are arrant ſlaves as any that ſerves in a Gally. It is a good ſaying of one of the Ancients; a good man though he ſerves, yet is he free; a wicked man; though he reigns, yet he is a ſervant: Thoſe that are not the ſervants of God, how many lords have they? the world, the fleſh, and the Divel; the world their ſervant, their fleſh their fellow, the Divel their enemy. There is no vaſsallage like unto this, beſides the woful reward in this life, and the life to come. And if you would have theſe ſlaves of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel painted out unto you by ſome ſignes. Firſt an arguing for ſin, and a defending of their evil waies. Secondly, An hating and diſliking of thoſe that reprove them for their ſins. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; A loving of thoſe that ſooth them; and flatter them in their evil waies, Fourthly, A

For the great comfort and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Regenerate: They are not the ſlaves of the Divel: they were indeed, but now they are not, but the ſervants of God: And this they may know, by reſiſting of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſuggeſtions, by denying of obedience unto his temptations; by mortifying that which is his Broker and Baud, to wit, ſin and corruption; by the daily renewing of our repentance; and ſo by their great rejoycing in taking notice of any to come from under his ſlavery. O what an eaſie ſervice is this in compariſon of the other!

                  <p>Now in the handling of this Doctrine, I obſerve the method following. 1. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you in ſome meaſure what Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is. 2. To prove the point, by Scripture, and Reaſons. 3. To anſwer ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 4. To make Appplication.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To acquaint you in ſome meaſure
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119999:59"/>what Damnation is? I ſay, <hi>in ſome meaſure,</hi> becauſe it cannot be expreſſed to the full, nor conceived in its largeſt extent, the wrath of God doth ſo appear in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Damnation contains in it theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a ſeparation from Gods comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſence: <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Depart from me ye that work iniquity:</hi> Thus our Saviour tells us he will ſay unto all the Reprobates at the day of Judgment, <hi>Depart from me.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Reprobate at the day of Judgement, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> Now as touching the wofulneſs of this ſeparation, do but ask the godly man or woman, the Lord being at any time abſent from them in their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. It is to be obſerved of <hi>Eli,</hi> and his daughter in Law, the perplexity they were in, and amazement they were put unto, when news was brought that the Ark was taken, which was was but a ſign of Gods preſence, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.17. and ſo to the end of the Chapter. And what a croſs was it to <hi>Abſolom</hi> when he might not ſee <hi>Davids face?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32. and <hi>David</hi> but a man: The miſery of this ſeparation is not to be conceived. And one thing that ſhall aggravate this part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119999:60"/>miſery, they ſhall ſee others enjoy what they have loſt. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28. <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to the Jewes) <hi>when ye ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out.</hi> This is the firſt Particular of Damnation, to wit, a ſeparation from Gods comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Particular Damnation compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, is, Society with the Divel and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. This is the Sentence which our Saviour will pronounce upon the Reprobate at the day of Judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Go ye cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Divel and his Angels.</hi> In this world the wicked love not to converſe with God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to aſſociate themſelves with the Saints and people of God; and therefore in the world to come, they ſhall have lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table companions, to wit, the Divel and his Angels. <hi>David</hi> complains of wicked and contentious neighbours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5. &amp;c. <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn in Meſech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar; my ſoul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.</hi> But what cauſe will the wicked have this way in hell? O how will our hair ſtart up if we think we ſee a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel! nay, do but ſpeak of a Divel and men
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119999:60"/>and women bleſs themſelves. We read of ſome of the Heathen, being Exiles, they could not look back on their own Countrys without grief and tears: but what will the wicked do in Hell, being baniſhed from God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and reſtrained to ſuch company as the Divel and his Angels? This is the ſecond Particular of Damnation; to wit, ſociety and fellowſhip with the Divel and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                  <p>The third Particular which Damnation compriſeth or contains, is; intollerable and unconceivable torment both of ſoul and body; O how ſhall the ſoul be tormented? This our Saviour ſets forth by a worm, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44. ſpeaking of the Damned in hell, <hi>Where their worm dyeth not.</hi> A worm lying gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the heart we know is great pain; and ſhall the body be free from puniſhment in hell? Nay, the puniſhment that ſhall be inflicted upon it, our Saviour ſets forth by fire, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44. <hi>And the fire is not quenched;</hi> and fire which is the moſt ſcalding and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Fire and brimſtone,</hi> as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. Now who can abide to touch the fire ſo much as with his finger?</p>
                  <p>The fourth Particular Damnation compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, is the univerſality of the torment. It ſhall extend to every faculty of ſoul, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119999:61"/>member of body. The Underſtanding ſhall diſcern Gods infinite wrath: The Memory ſhall be freſh to call the ſin that is paſt, and the aggravations of it: a hell ſhall be in the Conſcience; And all theſe implyed in the Worm fore-mentioned. And ſo likewiſe in hell every member of the body ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as may be obſerved of the Rich man in hell. mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24. <hi>And he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid, Father Abraham have mercy on me, and ſend Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame;</hi> as though hee ſhould ſay, every member of my body being tormented, but eſpecially my tongue.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Particular, or aggravation of Damnation, is <hi>Eternity.</hi> This ſeparation from Gods comfortable preſence muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual: This Society with the Divel and his Angels muſt be for ever: This intollerable and unconceivable torment of ſoul and body muſt be eternal. Every faculty of ſoul, and member of body muſt be tormented, and that for evermore. It is as if a man were preſſing to death, and could wiſh that more weight might be laid upon him; but cannot have his deſire. If thoſe that go to hell were but to continue there as many thouſand yeers
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119999:61"/>as there are ſands on the ſea ſhoare, or Stars in the Firmament, there were ſome hope and comfort: but alas, when never ſo many yeers are expired, the torments of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are as freſh to begin again as though they had never been. <hi>Their worm never dieth, and their fire never goeth out,</hi> Mark 9.44. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith our Saviour ſpeaking of the Reprobate) <hi>ſhall go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment.</hi> Thus we ſee in ſome meaſure, according to the Scriptures, what eternal Damnation is.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to prove the Point, to wit, that every one in the eſtate of corrupt nature is guilty of, is ſubject to eternal Damnation; John 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation:</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth thus much, that all but the true believer muſt come into condemnation. And ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> hinting plainly thus much, all living and dying out of Chriſt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, muſt be damned. And likewiſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous</hi> (thoſe that are in the eſtate of nature) <hi>ſhall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome of God?</hi> And if ſuch muſt not inherit heaven, what muſt they do that go to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119999:62"/>hell? And to the ſame purpoſe our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life, and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him.</hi> It is as much as if our Saviour ſhould have ſaid, All living and dying in the eſtate of nature, the wrath of God ſhall preſs them down to the pit of hell, they ſhall be damned. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41, 42. <hi>The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels</hi> (to wit, at the laſt Judgment) <hi>and they ſhall gather out of his kingdome all things that offend, and them that do iniquity</hi> (to wit, all the unregenerate) <hi>and ſhall caſt them into a furnace with fire; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers; and Socerers, and Idolaters, and all lyars, ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death;</hi> that is to ſay, whoſoever they be that have ſin unmortified in them (as every one in the eſtate of nature hath) ſhall be damned; that is to ſay, ſo living and ſo dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall be damned. Now we come to the Reaſons of the Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The unregenerate perſon is a ſinner and that divers wayes: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Now the wages of ſin is death,</hi> to wit, eternal.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:119999:62"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. The unregenerate perſon ſtands upon his owne bottome, is under the curſe, and ſo is to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice in his own perſon, living and dying in that eſtate, hath no benefit by Chriſts Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Interceſſion. <hi>Galatians</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them;</hi> that is, Curſed is every one that keeps not the whole Law, either by himſelf, or by another, to wit, Chriſt: It is true, the Regenerate, and ſuch as are in Chriſt, fulfil the Law in Chriſt (Chriſts obedience paſſive and active being theirs by imputation) and ſo freed from the Curſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> but the unregenerate are under the Curſe, the principal part whereof is eternal death and damnation. The Curſe doth not only contain all the miſeries of this life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, beſides the ſeparation both of ſoul and body by corporal death in the end; but likewiſe eternal death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world to come. The ſoul when by corporal death it goes out of the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed downe to hell by the wrath of God, and at the day of Judgment when both are conjoyned, both to be puniſhed according to the particulars aforeſaid.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:119999:63"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The conſciences of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſometimes even in this world, tell them no leſs then the Point comes unto; witneſs <hi>Cain, Abitophel,</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> When the Lord at any time, even in this life, is pleaſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and wound the conſciences of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, the very flaſhes of hell fire doth appear in them. Now we come to anſwer two Objections, and ſo to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But may ſome men ſay, If the bodies of the unregenerate ſhal be raiſed up at the laſt day, and their ſouls and bodies again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, and both to continue for ever, why is not their condition future, rather called eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, then eternal death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe that life which is called theirs, then is moſt miſerable death, and doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be called life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. But how can it ſtand with Gods juſtice to puniſh temporal offence with eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe ſin is an offence againſt an Infinite God, and ſo doth deſerve eternal puniſhment. 2. Did the unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon live eternally in this world, he would ſin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally. 3. The unregenerate damned in hell do not ceaſe to ſin; I do not ſay they commit Murder, Adultery, and ſuch like ſins, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in unbelief, impenitency, blaſphemy, &amp;c. Now to the Uſes.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:119999:63"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To reprove divers perſons: 1. Such as in their Conference and Diſcourſe do uſe this imprecation; That if this and that be not true which they affirm, they wiſh they might be damned: But do thoſe perſons conſider what damnation is of which they ſpeak ſo lightly?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To reprove ſuch as are offended at Gods Miniſters for preaching of damnation. Do not many of their people remain and continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate in the ſtate of nature? and doth not eternal damnation belong to ſuch? Why then ſhould they not preach in this manner unto them, for the awaking and rowzing of them up? Muſt not a Miniſter deal faithfully with his people? See what <hi>Balaam</hi> a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith to a King, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.13. <hi>If Balak would give me his houſe full of Silver and Gold I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord to do either good or bad of my own mind, but what the Lord ſaith, that will I ſpeak.</hi> If the Lord ſay in his Word that thoſe that live and dye in the eſtate of nature muſt be damned, how can the Miniſter (if he would be found faithful either to his Maſter or people) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it? <hi>Joſeph</hi> did not only tell the Butler the meaning of his dream, but likewiſe the Baker the meaning of his, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.19. <hi>Yet within three dayes ſhall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off

                  <p n="3">3. To reprove all ſuch as neglect the means whereby they might be brought out of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of nature, to which eternal damnation belongs. No better means to prepare for this buſineſs, then a thundring and powerful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. A call to repentance, unto all ſuch as are in the eſtate of nature, as ignorant perſons Swearers, Curſers, Profaners of the Sabbath, Whoremaſters, Drunkards, Oppreſſors, Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Greedy Earth-worms, Contemners of the Goſpel, Deſpiſers of Gods Miniſters, who all proclaim themſelves to be in the eſtate of nature. O that ſuch would conſider the woful caſe they are in. To be under the Curſe (as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119999:64"/>the unregenerate perſon is) is no little miſery To be ſubject to all outward calamities in this life; nay, to have many Spiritual plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as blindneſs of mind, hardneſs of heart, and many times terrors of conſcience, even the flaſhes of hell fire in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and when by temporal death the ſoul goeth out of the body, the wrath of God to preſs it down to the pit of hell, and there to be in unſpeakable, nay, unconceivable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until the day of Judgment; and then, when the ſoul and body ſhall be again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to appear and ſtand before, 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>This Title is a Title of benefits, it ſignifying an Author of ſafety, our Saviour as we
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119999:66"/>may obſerve the Angel to interpret, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Matth. 1.21. <hi>Thov ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, but take notice of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt him and them. 1. They had his name impoſed on them by the will of men but he had his name given him by an Angel from God. 2. They were but typical Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, he the Saviour indeed. 3. They were but temporal and outward Saviours, he a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Saviour. 4. They were but Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Saviours, he the Author of all good things, Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, but the difference is in their manner of ſaving. The Father ſaveth by the Son; the Son ſaveth by paying the Ranſome and price of ſalvation; the Holy Ghoſt ſaveth by a particular applying of this Ranſome. Two Queſtions following to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and then we come to Application, 1. Whom this Jeſus ſaves? 2. From what?</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Whom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Angel tells us whom in the place
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119999:66"/>forecited, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. calls him <hi>The Saviour of his body;</hi> to wit, of all the Elect.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> The Application may be to inform us two wayes: 1. Touching our miſerable loſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by nature, for ſo much a Saviour implies: And the truth of it is, we can never rightly and comfortably acknowledg this Saviour, until we be ſenſible this way. Many ſpeak of this Saviour as their Saviour, but when were they dejected and caſt down with a ſight and ſenſe of their own miſery by nature? <hi>The Son of man is come</hi> (ſaith our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.11.) <hi>to ſave that which was loſt;</hi> that is to ſay, thoſe that were ſenſible of their loſt eſtate and condition: but divers very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and inſenſible this way, wil yet cal him their Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To inform us touching the great mercy of God to mankind. Satan and his Angels fell but have no Saviour; man falls, and the Lord deviſeth and affordeth a Saviour. Now to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119999:67"/>this Saviour, (ſeeing and feeling our miſery) let us fly, ſaying and praying with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.25. <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh:</hi> and with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 35.3. <hi>Say unto our ſouls, Thou art our ſalvation:</hi> Conſidering that comfortable Text he himſelf preach'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the truth of which, he came into the world to make good, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath annointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor; he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the Captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>He began to ſay unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond Title, <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which is a Title of Office, and ſignifies An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. There were three ſorts of perſons annointed in the time of the Old Teſtament; Prophets, Prieſts, and Kings, who were all types of this Annointed, of this Prophet, Prieſt and King. That we may the better underſtand this Title, we intend to anſwer the Queſtions following: 1. Why this Jeſus is ſaid to be annointed? 2. With what? 3. His Office of Mediatorſhip, what it is in the three parts of it: 4. The benefits the Elect have by it. Laſtly, The Duties intimated.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:119999:67"/>
                  <p>The firſt Queſtion is, Why this Jeſus is ſaid to be anointed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In ancient time, two things were intimated by this Anointing. 1. That God did appoint ſuch a perſon to ſuch an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. 2. That he would fit and qualifie him for the ſame. In both theſe reſpects Jeſus is ſaid to be anointed. 1. He was ſet apart of God the Father to the Office of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for (although this be a common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Trinity), yet becauſe the Father is the firſt Perſon in order, and hath the beginning of the action, it is eſpecially aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed unto him, according to that <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> 2. He was fitted and qualified with gifts accordingly, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. <hi>God giveth not the Spirit by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto him:</hi> that is to ſay, God giveth the Spirit unto him; that is, unto this Jeſus, in an abundant meaſure: For this we muſt know, that although <hi>both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> were ſet apart to the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, why yet the <hi>Humane nature</hi> only was qualified with gifts, becauſe nothing could be added to the Divine; I ſay, this qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt be underſtood of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not of the Divine, for the reaſon aforeſaid; and although the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119999:68"/>was iqualified with pifts in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant meaſure, why yet not in an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite meaſure, for that were to confound the two Natures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2 With what was this Jeſus annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not with Ceremonious oyl typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as the Prophets, Prieſts, and Kings in the old Teſtament; but with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. <hi>God annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jeſus of Nazareth with the holy Ghoſt, and with power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3 His office of mediatorſhip, what it is in the three parts of it? Prophetical, Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Kingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, of the firſt, his Prophetical office, is that whereby he inſtructeth and teacheth his Church, as in his own perſon, when in our nature he lived in the world; why ſo by his inſtruments before his aſſuming our nature, and ſince his aſcenſion, unto the end of the world. That he is the Prophet of the Church, do but ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23. where the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>For Moſes truly ſaid unto the fathers, A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, of your brethren like unto me; him ſhall you hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119999:68"/>And it ſhall come to paſs, that every ſoul that wil not hear that prophet, ſhall be destroyed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people.</hi> And hence is he called <hi>the wiſdome of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24 Nay, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul, Coloſ.</hi> 2.5. <hi>In him are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom and knowledg.</hi>

Secondly, his interceſſion at his Fathers right hand; he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver living to preſent the ment of his obedience to his Father, and to will an application of it to his elect. Touching the former part of his Prieſtly office, to wit, his ſatisfaction; do but ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrificing of himſelf;</hi> and verſe twenty eight, <hi>Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many,</hi> to wit, of the Elect; all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Touching the other part of his Prieſtly office, his interceſſion; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever lives to make interceſſion for them. Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We come to the Kingly office of Chriſt:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119999:69"/>That he is a King, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>David</hi> there ſpeaking of him, ſaith, <hi>yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion:</hi> His Kingly office, is either Univerſall or ſpeciall; Univerſal, and ſo all creatures are under his dominion, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 1.21, 22. Special, and ſo he effectually cals the Elect, confirms the graces in them, protects them from their enemies in this world, as he ſees the beſt for them, glorifies them at the length, and in the end, confounds and deſtroys all his and their enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4 What are the benefits the Elect have by this annointing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hence it is the Elect become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and Chriſtians indeed; that they are ſpirituall Prophets, Prieſts, and Kings. Men and women no ſooner truely beleeve, are no ſooner effectually called, but they receive of this annointing, and ſo become Chriſtians, Spirituall Prophets, Prieſts, and Kings: to this purpoſe, ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>The annointing which ye received of him, abideth in you, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth you all things:</hi> So then the regenerate are ſpirituall Prophets; and they are likewiſe ſpiritual Prieſts; and Kings, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. <hi>who hath made us kings, and prieſts unto God &amp; his Father</hi>

                  <p>The laſt queſtion. What are the duties inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated? <hi>An.</hi> 1 Seeing this Jeſus is the Chriſt, is the annointed, he ſhould be ſweet and ſavory
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119999:69"/>unto us. <hi>Cant.</hi> 13. <hi>Becauſe of the ſavor of thy good ointments, thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins love thee.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be ſo deſired of us, ſo affected by us, as Chriſt. 2. We ſhould labour more, and more for holy knowledg, and ſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelves to partake of Chriſt propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office. Many exhortations this way. <hi>Provt</hi> 19.2. <hi>without knowledg, the mind is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good.</hi> John 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. 3.16. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwel in you richly in all wiſedome:</hi> And how the Apoſtle reproves the Hebrews for their bad proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy this way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. &amp;c. 3. We ſhould demonſtrate our ſelves to be ſpirituall Prieſts, (and ſo to partake of Chriſts Prieſtly office) by ſpirituall Sacrifices; as firſt, by being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in prayer and praiſe, as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>By him therefore let us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Sacrifice of praiſe to God continually.</hi> 2.

We ſhould demonſtrate our ſelves to be ſpirituall Kings, (and ſo to partake of Chriſts Kingly office) and this by continual warring with our ſpiritual enemies, eſpecially
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119999:70"/>labouring to ſubdue our own ſinfull paſſions, and affections, ſee what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith this way, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.28. <hi>He that hath no rule over his own ſpirit, is like a City that is broken down, and without wals.</hi> And Prov. 16.32. <hi>He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty; and he that ruleth his ſpirit, then he that taketh a City.</hi> Thus much touching the ſecond title, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we come to the third.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Son of God,</hi> illuſtrate by this epethite, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, Jeſus Chriſt the eternal Son of God.</hi> The Son of God, not by <hi>Creation</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.38. <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. Not by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, as all true beleevers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. Not by grace of <hi>perſonal union,</hi> as the man Chriſt <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. But by <hi>Generation,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4.9. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</hi> For the opening of this myſterie, we propound the queſtions following; 1. The thing generated, 2. How? or the manner of this generation? 3. When?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The thing it ſelf generated,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſt;</hi> who is to be conſidered two waies: 1. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his eſſence. 2. According to his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal exiſtence; that is, as he is God, and as he is a Son; as he is a Son and perſon, he is not of himſelf, but the Son of the Father by generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119999:70"/>as he is a God, and in reſpect of his abſolute eſſence, he is of himſelf neither begotten, nor proceeding: One eſſence doth not beget ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but one perſon another; the perſon of the Father, the perſon of the Son, and ſo the Son is God of God, and no otherwiſe; hath from his Father the beginning of his perſon, but not the beginning of his eſſence.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond queſtion, <hi>The manner of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Anſw.</hi> we muſt know it is ineffable. Some Divines ſay, it is begotten of the Father, as the light of the Sun in the firmament, by a ſimple emanation, paſſing, or flowing out; light of light, ſaith one of the Creed: But take we notice of the holy Ghoſts metaphor, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word;</hi> ſo the ſecond perſon in Trinity is called. As the ſpeech is in the mind, and the mind in the ſpeech; ſo is God the Son, of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 3 <hi>The time of this generation? Anſ</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worlds, The ſecond perſon in Trinity is the Son of God the Father, eternal by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, according to the Chatechiſm: and to this purpoſe, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, <hi>and</hi> 23. <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old; I was ſet up from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> Which place we are to underſtand of the ſecond perſon in Trinity. In this
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119999:71"/>generation there is priority of order, but not of time, the Father and the Son being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternall. Now we come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. How the two Natures in Chriſt remain diſtinguiſhed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt know, that although the two natures in Chriſt be ſo really united, as that they can never be ſeparated aſunder, yet are they not confounded, but remaine diſtinguiſhed. 1. In <hi>themſelves:</hi> 2. In their <hi>Properties:</hi> 3, In their <hi>Actions.</hi> 1. In <hi>Themſelves:</hi> As the Godhead of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the Godhead, and is not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, although the Son of God be alſo very man, and ſo the manhood of Chriſt remains the manhood, and is not the Godhead, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the man Chriſt be alſo God. 2. They remain diſtinguiſhed in their <hi>Properties,</hi> as the Godhead of Chriſt remains Incomprehenſible and Infinite, as it hath alwaies been, and the manhood remains, comprehenſible and finite, notwithſtanding the uniting of it to the ſecond Perſon in Trinity: The Godhead becomes not finite by this Union, nor the manhood Infinite. 3. They remaine diſtinguiſhed in their <hi>Actions,</hi> as <hi>John, chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>I have power to lay downe my life</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>and power to take it againe.</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:119999:73"/>The laying down of his life, was an action of his Man-hood the taking it again, an action of his God-head. Thus we ſee the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt, with their properties and actions diſtinguiſhed, and yet in regard of the union of the two natures, we muſt take notice of the things following: 1. That in Scriputre, that is ſometimes aſcribed to whole Chriſt, which is but proper to one of his natures; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. Sometimes that aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one of his natures, which agreeth to whole Chriſt; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. Sometimes that aſcribed to one nature, which is proper to the other; <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and this Divines call, the communication of properties. 2. That notwithſtanding the two natures in Chriſt remain diſtinguiſhed, as aforeſaid, yet they both concur in the work of Redemption. 3. That by this union, the humane nature is unſpeakably, and extraordinarily exalted; to wit, above all creatures, even the Angels themſelves, and together with the God-head of Chriſt to be adored and worſhiped.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The principal, and next to Gods glory, was to merit for the Elect remiſſion of ſins, and freedome from puniſhment, <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.14. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law.</hi> We muſt not conceive of Chriſts ſufferings as the ſufferings of a private man, but as the ſufferings of a publick perſon; he being our Pledge and Surety, as he is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. And whatſoever he ſuffered, he ſuffered for us; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Who was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for our offences:</hi> that is to ſay, to death. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. very comfortably; <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree.</hi> And hence it is, that he is ſaid to be <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and a <hi>Curſe</hi> for us, <hi>Galatians</hi> 3.13. Here take we notice of the difference between the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the ſufferings of Martyrs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſts ſufferings were an acurſed pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. The ſufferings of Martyrs are onely Chaſtiſements or Tryals. 2. Chriſts
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119999:79"/>ſufferings were Meritorious, ſo are not the ſufferings of Martyrs; but a duty, and debt. There be other ends of Chriſts Paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as the mortifying of ſin in the Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is Crucified with him, that the body of ſinne might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſinne.</hi> And the giving of them an example of ſuffering patiently, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.21. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> Thus we have the five Queſtions anſwered. Now we come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To inform us, and that divers wayes. 1. To let us ſee into the fierceneſs of Gods Wrath, and wonderful Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne; when nothing could expiate it but the death of his Sonne, when nothing could ſatisfie for it, but the blood of the Lord Jeſus; what think we then of thoſe that make nothing of ſinne, do not account it to be of an horrible and accurſed nature?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See we here the great love of God the Father, that rather then we ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh everlaſtingly, his Sonne muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for us; he muſt ſatisfie for us, become ſinne, become a Curſe for us, dye the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death of the Croſs for our ſakes, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> (it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119999:80"/>be expreſſed how much) <hi>that he gave his onely begotten Sonne to dye for us. In this God commendeth his love unto us,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Romans 8. And <hi>in this he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his love unto us,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Herein is love;</hi> indeed a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of love, that God the Father ſhould ſo love his enemies, as to give his onely Sonne to dye for them. Very moving is that phraſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Sonne, but delivered him up for us all;</hi> as though he had loved us better then his own Son. As the Lord ſaith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22.12. (when at his command he was ready to offer up his only ſon <hi>Iſaac: Now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy ſonne, thy onely ſonne from me.</hi> So may we ſay of God, that we know that he loved us, becauſe he hath not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his Son, his onely Son from us, but hath given him to that accurſed death for our ſakes. 3. See we here the great love of Chriſt himſelf, unto his Church; that rather then ſhe ſhould periſh, he would give himſelf to death, even the accurſed death of the Croſs; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Who gave himſelf for our ſinnes:</hi> which phraſe intimates unto us, how willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he laid down his life for our ſake. Now indeed, had not his death been voluntary,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119999:80"/>it could not have been ſatisfactory. But that he laid down his life willingly for us, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by many circumſtances about his death; as when <hi>Peter</hi> counſelled him <hi>to ſpare himſelf,</hi> ſee what he got for his labour, <hi>Matthew</hi> 16.23. <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> ſaith Chriſt unto him. And when <hi>Judas</hi> was ready to betray him, ſee what our Saviour ſaith unto him, <hi>John</hi> 13.27. <hi>That thou doſt, do quickly.</hi> And when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone out, to get com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to apprehend him, he went to the place he had wont to be in, ſo as <hi>Judas</hi> might readily find him; nay, he met them in the mid-way, that came to take him, and tells them he was the Party they ſought for; and when they fell to the ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſaying, <hi>I am he;</hi> he would not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from them. All theſe particulars you may obſerve in the eighteenth Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> Verſe firſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He could have been reſcued by the Angels, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 26.53.) but would not; and when by his Adverſaries he was provoked to have come down from the Croſs, (<hi>Matthew</hi> 27.42.) and could have done ſo, he would not. All theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances let us ſee, how willingly he laid downe his life for our ſakes, according to that he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it downe of my ſelfe:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119999:81"/>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> And doth not this much commend the love of Chriſt to us, he ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly laying down his life for us?

Doth at any time the weight and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin, with the wrath of God due for the ſame, oppreſſe them? let them weigh and perpend the price of their redemption, the great ranſome was given for them; to wit, the precious blood of the Son of God: as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things, as Silver, and Gold; but with the precious bloud of Chriſt:</hi> A ranſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable, and of infinite merit. It being more (the paſſion of Chriſt for a ſhort time) then if all men and Angels had ſuffered for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hath God the Father out of his infinite love, given his Son to die for thee? then do not thou doubt the ſupply of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries inward, and outward; he that hath given the greater, will alſo give the leſſer; Chriſt is more worth then ten thouſand
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119999:81"/>worlds, and Chriſt is the ſweet and pleaſant fountain of all other good things. It is for him, and through him, that we have any thing, that is good; ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> The Lord that hath given thee Chriſt, and him to die for thee, will give thee an increaſe of grace, will give thee to perſevere in grace; nay, in the end, will give thee <hi>eternal life.

And in regard of outward things, it is comfortable to hear what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>The young Lions do lack and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hunger; but they that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> And Heb. 13.5. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee;</hi> For <hi>let God be true and every man a liar.</hi> But this is an argument of arguments, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle uſeth to perſwade true beleevers, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their outward ſupply; I mean, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. To exhort every one of us to hate, and ſhun ſin for the time to come. Oh, How can we love that, how can we favour that, which nailed the Son of God to the croſſe? Will not we labour to die to that, for which the Son of God dyed? O let us down with this body of ſin; as the Apoſtle hath it in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body, and bring

Surely, to go on in ſin, is horrible ingratitude to God, and Chriſt; nay, the truth of it is, we ſhould be ſo affected to God who gave Chriſt, and to Chriſt who gave himſelf to that accurſed death of the Croſſe for our ſins, as we ſhould rather our ſelves admit of death, even the moſt bitter and torturing death, then admit of the leaſt ſin wittingly, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Did God the Father ſo love us, as to give us his Son; nay the Son ſo love us, as to give himſelf to death for our ſakes? why then upon a juſt occaſion and call let us not think much to let our deareſt blood goe for Gods ſake, for Chriſt ſake. Shall Chriſt the Sonne of God willingly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119999:83"/>dye for us, and ſhall we not willingly lay down our lives for him and for his Truth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a call, that ſo we may glorifie him? <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.19. And for his people upon a call, that ſo we may manifeſt that his example ſwayes us? as 1 John 3.16. <hi>Herby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bren.</hi>

                  <p>Doct. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the eternal Son of God, although he was crucified to death as he was man, yet was he a juſt and righteous man.</hi> In the proſecution of this Point, we are only to make good the latter part of the Doctrine, to wit, that Chriſt even as he was man, was Juſt and Righteous: To this purpoſe ſee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119999:83"/>2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us</hi> (that is to ſay, a ſinner by imputation) <hi>who knew no ſin;</hi> that is to ſay, who was without ſin. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>We have not an high Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> And hence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls him, <hi>A Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. And that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>He is the end of the Law;</hi> that is to ſay, the perfection of the Law; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Law could exact, he not only ſuffered but likewiſe was, and did.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to know that Chriſt as he was man, was righteous two wayes: 1. In his Birth and Conception. 2. In his life and converſation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In his <hi>Birth and Conception:</hi> Luke 1.35 <hi>And the Angel anſwered and ſaid unto her,</hi> (to wit, to <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Chriſt) <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee; therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> So Matth. 1.20. <hi>Joſeph thou ſon of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in her is of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And although <hi>Mary</hi> was a ſinner, yet the Holy Ghoſt knew
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119999:84"/>well enough how to cleanſe and purge from ſin that part of her ſubſtance of which Chriſts humane nature was made; and for the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, it did not belong unto him, he not coming from <hi>Adam</hi> by natural generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but by a miraculous Conception. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in his Conception and Birth, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was not only free from ſin, but withal inriched and filled with Grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and that in greater meaſure then all men and Angels; as <hi>John</hi> 1.14. The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt ſpeaking of him, and according to his humane nature, ſaith, he was <hi>full of Grace:</hi> and in <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure unto him;</hi> that is to ſay, he gave it unto him in an abundant meaſure: and yet the Holineſs of Chriſt as man, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, but finite; there being this difference betwixt his Righteouſneſs as he is God, and his righteouſneſs as he is man. His righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as he is God being infinite and uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: his Righteouſneſs as he is man being finite and created. Thus we ſee, even as Chriſt was man he was righteous in his Birth and Conception.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As he was man, he was righteous like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in his <hi>Life and Converſation:</hi> his whole courſe of life being conformable to the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Righteouſneſs of the Law: as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.

                     <hi>Who did no ſin,</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 8.29. <hi>He that hath ſent me is with me; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not left me alone, for I do always thoſe things which pleaſe him.</hi>

If perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and eternal life be merited by Chriſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive obedience, how comes it to paſs that the Scriptures ſpeak ſo little of this kind of obedience, and ſo much of his Paſſive?</p>

And as we muſt not think that every particular man and woman ſhall be ſaved; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt not think that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man and woman may be ſaved if they will: And amongſt other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons this is one; juſtifying faith is not in mans power (it being a ſupernaturall gift) and without it, no man can have any ſaving benefit by Chriſt; now that juſtifying faith is not in mans power, ſee <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me;</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>except the Father which hath ſent me draw him. No man can come to me,</hi> that is, no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in me, except it be given him of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And further, becauſe we ſay that Chriſts ſatisfaction was ſufficient for all mankind, yet only effectual to the Elect, we muſt not think any part of it to be ſuperfluous, becauſe the merit of Chriſts ſatisfaction, is not to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by parts; but the whole merit is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119999:92"/>to each particular perſon that ſhall be ſaved. We proceed to the Uſes.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond ſigne is a dear love to God, <hi>John</hi> 4.9. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> that is, becauſe in Chriſt we firſt apprehend his love unto us: when a man apprehends Gods love unto him in the Lord Jeſus, how he gave the Lord Jeſus unto him to free him from miſery, and to make him eternally happy, then he cannot but love the Lord again. A man may receive all outward gifts from God, and never love him; but a man cannot receive this gift from God, to wit, be aſſured that God hath given him Chriſt, and pardon of ſinnes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life in and through him, but he

                  <p>The third ſigne the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> laies us down <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts.</hi> Sinne doth not raigne as king in thoſe that are united to Chriſt, that they ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it in the luſts thereof; no, their very ſinful paſſions, affections, and deſires, are a great trouble, and grief unto them, as we may obſerve in the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> complaint; <hi>Romans</hi> 7.24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am; who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This contrition and humiliation, contains the particulars following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A true and diſtinct ſight of ſin, and not onely as puniſhment doth attend it, but as it is vile and lothſome in its own nature; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your own evil wayes, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your iniquities, and for your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. A being weary of ſin, finding it a load, and burden upon the conſcience, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119999:98"/>
                     <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour means here, all that have contrite and humble ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Humble and hearty confeſſion of ſin, as <hi>Luke</hi> 15.21. <hi>Father</hi> (ſaith the Prodigal) <hi>I have ſinned againſt heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon.</hi> Lu. 23.40, 41.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Earneſt ſuit to the God of heaven for mercy, as the Publicane, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> And <hi>Saul,</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. <hi>Behold he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> ſurely the three dayes he was without ſight, he ſent up many a loud cry to heaven for mercy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth particular. This Contrition and Humiliation contains a diſtaſte, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of ſin; as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30.22. <hi>Ye ſhall defile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the covering of the graven Images of ſilver, and the ornament of thy molten Images of gold, thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſturous cloth,</hi> (to wit, in the day of thy repentance) <hi>thou ſhalt ſay unto it, get thee hence.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. Zacheus <hi>ſtood and ſaid unto the Lord, Behold Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him four fold.</hi> Thus we ſee now what Contrition and Humiliation is, which truly and ſufficiently prepares a man,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119999:98"/>or a woman to be made partakers of Chriſt, and his benefits.</p>
                  <p>But yet we muſt not think this preparatory work in the particulars aforeſaid, to be the ſame that is in the ſoul after Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and partaked of; for that flows from the Principle of grace, and ſo works more freely, and abſolutely: But in this the ſoul is onely a Patient;, this is a ſaving work, but not a ſanctifying work; but yet alwayes ſanctification followes upon the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Whether every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath this Contrite and Humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhall certainly be made partakers of Chriſt and his benefits?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, becauſe this is the loſt ſoul which Chriſt came to <hi>ſeek, and to ſave;</hi> for of this ſoul, we muſt underſtand our Saviour, when he ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.20. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> And this is the <hi>bruiſed reed,</hi> which in no caſe he will break; <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. And do but ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. <hi>A broken and a contrite heart, O God thou wilt not deſpiſe:</hi> not the broken and contrite heart aforeſaid. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe Name is HOLY: I dwell in the high and holy place;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119999:99"/>with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi> And ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3.4. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> And <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted:</hi> It is the contrite and humble ones, which our Saviour here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. Thus we ſee diſtinctly and plainly, that every man and woman, that hath the contrite and humble ſpirit aforeſaid, ſhall certainly be made partakers of Chriſt, and his benefits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Whether this contrition and humiliation be wrought in the like meaſure, in all that are made partakers of Chriſt and his benefits?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; and for the Cauſes and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons following:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some have committed more groſs and heinous ſins then others, and therefore have cauſe, and need to be more terrified and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled then others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord intends to beſtow a greater meaſure of grace upon ſome then upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; to do greater works by them, then by others; and therefore prepares them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly by contrition and humiliation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some have been Religiouſly educated
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119999:99"/>from their Child-hood, whereby as they were kept from groſs ſins, ſo corruption was ſubdued in them gently, and ſecretly, by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, without any great meaſure of contrition and humiliation; grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort being inſtilled into them almoſt inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some by natural conſtitution, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of body, are more fearful and ſenſible of anguiſh then others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Some after the Wound, have the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ſooner revealed and applyed to them then others.</p>
                  <p>Now we proceed to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To acquaint us, that there is but a few, comparatively, that partake of Chriſt, and his benefits; and this will be evident, if ſo be we weigh the particulars, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and humiliation aforeſaid contains.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, a true and diſtinct ſight of ſin: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſee their ſins in a general, ſlight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed way; but where is the man that ſees ſin to be the greateſt <hi>evil,</hi> even ſeparating from the greateſt <hi>good;</hi> to wit, God himſelf? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59.2. nay, that ſo far as he gives way unto it, ſo far he joynes with the Divel, and fights againſt God; that ſees into the vile and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom nature of ſin? And where is the man that ſees himſelf to be guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> fall,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119999:100"/>himſelf to be ſtained, and polluted univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with natural corruption, himſelf to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch, and ſuch actual ſins, ſins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſins of Commiſſion, that turns his ſins upſide down, conſiders them in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond particular the contrition and humiliation aforeſaid contains, is, unfained and ſound ſorrow for ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.16, 17. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, the moſt, ſin is their meat, and their drink, their very delight; they ſtorm, and grieve, becauſe they cannot ſin as they would; are ſorry, and angry they have ſuch a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as will reprove them for their ſins, that they may not go on in ſin without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; or if they have any ſorrow in them at any time, it is onely becauſe of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that attends ſin. Many that mourn for this and that outward croſs and calamity preſent, and imminent; but do not at al mourn for ſin, the cauſe of it; but a few whoſe hearts are rightly <hi>pricked</hi> for their ſins. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for the other particulars: Where is the man that finds ſin a load and burden upon his conſcience? that doth humbly, and heartily confeſs his ſins? that importunately cryes to heaven for mercy? and that truly diſlikes ſin, even to a ſinful thought? The
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119999:100"/>particulars aforeſaid being perpended, it will appear, that there is but a few that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and humble ſpirits, and ſo conſequently but a few that partake of Chriſt, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For the comfort and conſolation of all ſuch as have contrite and humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: they, all they ſhall partake of Chriſt, and his benefits: ſuch, all ſuch are they whom Chriſt came to ſeek, and to ſave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. <hi>The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> Iſa. 57.15. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>all ye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> The Lord doth not deal with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened conſcience, as Satan and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Satan, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 12.4.) when the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ready to be delivered of her Child, was ready to devour her Child; and ſo are his Inſtruments: Now we hope (ſay they) you have followed Preachers, gone to Sermons long enough; no, no, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.3. <hi>He heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds:</hi> to wit, the Lord, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 61.1. And to this purpoſe, it is a wondrous thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how the Lord ſuſtains and bears up the wounded ſoul, by a ſecret hope of mercy; as we may ſee in the King of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> Jonah 3.9.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119999:101"/>9. <hi>Who can tell if God will turn, and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not?</hi> But for this hope, the bruiſed heart would break; and but for this hope, the means of recovery and raiſing up, would not be endeavored. This hope keeps from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and provokes to the uſe of holy means. It is true, ſaith the wounded ſoul, I am in a miſerable caſe; but if there be any hope, I will cry to heaven for mercy; I will depend upon the Miniſtry of the word conſtantly; I will creep into the company of thoſe that make profeſſion of Religion, in a ſpecial manner; who can tell but that the Lord may ſhew mercy to my poor ſoul?</p>
                  <p>May ſome man ſay, this is very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that every contrite and humble ſpirit ſhall certainly pertake of Chriſt, and his benefits. But how may I know that my heart is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrite and humble?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Signes</hi> 1. If thou judgeſt ſin to be the greateſt <hi>evil,</hi> and the favour of God to be the greateſt <hi>good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou hadſt rather hear of mercy to thy poor ſoul then of an earthly Kingdome to be beſtowed upon thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If thou thinkeſt thoſe that have true <hi>Peace of conſcience, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be the happieſt people under the ſun.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:119999:101"/>
                  <p n="4">4. If thou tremble at the Word, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the very feet of thoſe Inſtruments <hi>that bring glad tydings of peace</hi> to ſuch as thy ſelf; to wit, to wounded conſciences.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If thou ſend up ſtrong and unceſſant cryes to God for the aſſurance of his favour in and through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If thou doſt pity and compaſſionate all ſuch, as have broken and bruiſed hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. To exhort all ſuch, as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent have not contrite and humble ſpirits, to labour and endeavour for that diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motives.</hi> 1. The contrary diſpoſition, to wit, <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> and <hi>impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> is a great ſin, and a grievous judgement: A great ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>But thou after thy hard and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> A grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous judgement: <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.12. <hi>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 12.40. Now there be two kinds of hardneſs of heart: 1. Senſible, that which is perceived and felt; and this may be in the godly, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. <hi>Oh Lord, why haſt thou made us to erre from thy wayes, and heardened our hearts from thy fear?</hi> 2. Inſenſible, that which is not perceived and felt; and this indeed is a great ſin and plague.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:119999:102"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Motive. The ſooner we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after this diſpoſition, the more eaſily in likelyhood we ſhall attain unto it: when a heart hath been long hardened with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin, it will not eaſily become a contrite and humble heart; and therefore <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95.7.8. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> So <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12, 13. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it may be hereafter we ſhall not enjoy the like means this way, we do for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Without this contrite and humble ſpirit (according to the Doctrine) we cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſt, and his benefits: this is the Meſſenger that Chriſt ever ſends before him unto thoſe of years, (for we do not now ſpeak of Infants) and wo be unto us, if we do not partake of Chriſt, and his benefits; it had been good for us, we had never been born.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whoſoever hath this contrite and humble ſpirit, ſhall certainly partake of Chriſt, and his benefits. Now this may great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induce us to labour for this diſpoſition, when the iſſue undoubtedly ſhall be ſo good, and ſo happy. Suppoſe this buſineſs be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and tedious, why yet ſuch an iſſue muſt needs put us on in it. Theſe are the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:119999:102"/>
                  <p>Now we proceed to the Means of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and humble ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means.</hi> 1. Prayer to God in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we can; it is he that muſt bruiſe our hard and ſtony hearts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh;</hi> to wit, a contrite and humble heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Lord doth many times make uſe of afflictions and judgements, for the bruiſing of mens hearts; when he ſends any great affliction upon us, let us not ſtand out againſt him, but joyn with him: when he goes a bout to humble us, let us labour to humble our ſelves, as <hi>Saul</hi> (afterwards called <hi>Paul) Acts</hi> 9.6. trembling, and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> When the hand of God is upon us, let us not ſtand murmuring and repining, but fall to examination of our Spiritual eſtates and caſes, as the Wiſe-man adviſeth us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>In the day of adverſity, conſider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſtant dependance upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Word, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. <hi>Is not my word like as a fire,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and like a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that breaketh the Rocks in pieces?</hi> Now we are to know that the Law hath a ſtroke in this work, and ſo the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Law, by revealing of ſin, and the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119999:103"/>woful conſequents of it, and ſo (the Spirit of God co-operating) there is cauſed a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear, and trembling; a kind of contrition, and humiliation; which the Apoſtle, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.) cals <hi>the ſpirit of bondage, cauſing fear;</hi> when the Spirit of God puts an edge upon the Law, puts a ſword into the hand of the Law, to prick and wound the heart, and to reſtrain it in the wayes of ſin for fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Many a man and woman hears the Law opened, and the threatnings of it thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringly denounced, but ſtir not, are little moved: but when once the Lord by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit puts an edge upon the Law, then the ſtouteſt heart trembles and quakes. Now that the Law may have a kindly work upon us, 1. By the Law let us labour for a diſtinct knowledge of ſin. 2. Rightly to underſtand what the Curſe is, which the Law threatneth unto ſin and ſinners. 3. Examine our ſelves how guilty we are of that which the Law threatens the Curſe unto; to wit, ſin. 4. Finding our ſelves guilty, to labour our hearts to a deep contrition and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now, (as we have heard before) as the Law hath a ſtroke in this work, why ſo the Goſpel; more and more melting the heart, by diſcovering Chriſt, whom the ſinner
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119999:103"/>hath pierced by his ſins; and by ſupporting the heart by a ſecret hope of mercy, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of help, in and through Chriſt; even as <hi>Jonah,</hi> Chap. 2. verſe 4. <hi>Then I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight, yet I will look again toward thy holy Temple.</hi> Or as the Prodigal Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17, 18. <hi>And when he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſaid, How many hired ſervants of my fathers houſe have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger? I will ariſe, and go to my father, and will ſay unto him, father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee, &amp;c.</hi> Now after the Law hath humbled us, and the Goſpel conveyed this glimpſe of hope into our hearts, it muſt be nouriſhed and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By conſidering of the Lords Infinite and Almighty Power, how he is able more and more to bruiſe our ſouls, to make us more and more capable of Chriſt, and ſo to bring Chriſt nearer unto us, that we may partake of him, and his benefits; <hi>Luke</hi> 1.37. <hi>With God nothing ſhall be unpoſſible.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. <hi>God is able of ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The freeneſs of Gods mercy muſt be conſidered of; he requires nothing of thee to procure this mercy, but ſhewes mercy, becauſe he will ſhew mercy. Suppoſe thou
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119999:104"/>haſt never ſo many exceptions to thy ſelf, why yet thou belonging unto him, and his mercy being a free mercy, he will proceed with thee, until he hath made thee capable of Chriſt, and beſtowed Chriſt upon thee, and his benefits; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for mine own ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For ſupporting of this hope, conſider we of the riches of Gods mercy, unto the proper objects of mercy, Contrite and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men and women; ſuch as mourn, becauſe they can mourn no more for their ſins; ſuch as would fain look towards Chriſt, whom nothing can ſatisfie but Chriſt; ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far by occaſion of the firſt Member of the fourth Principle.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond Member thereof.</p>

                  <p>WHerein the Catechiſme further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, how we may be made partakers of Chriſt, and his benefits. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this:</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>That a man may partake of Chriſt and his benefits, he muſt not onely have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and humble ſpirit, but he muſt likewiſe be qualified with faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe we have already ſpoken of a contrite and humble ſpirit, take the point in a more brief form; as thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a man may partake of Chriſt and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, he muſt have faith, he muſt believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See <hi>John</hi> 3.14.15. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould receive remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> And Chapter 13. the 38, and 39 verſes. <hi>Be it known unto you, Men, and Brethren, that through this man is Preached unto you the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſinnes, and by him, all that believe,

                  <p>Now the Reaſons of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Faith is the condition of the new Covenant, the Covenant of grace; which is evident, as in the places fore-cited, ſo in other places; as <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every creature, he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 29.31. <hi>Theſe ſayings are written, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Sonne of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ye might have Life through his Name.</hi>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Faith is the onely Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall hand, whereby we receive Chriſt, and his benefits; as <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſonnes of God, even to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his Name.</hi> No faith, no receiving of Chriſt, and then no benefit by him. And
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119999:105"/>it is not every faith that will do this, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that faith which by way of propriety is called the <hi>faith of Gods Elect,</hi> Titus 1.2 none but the Elect having it, and all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect being poſſeſſed of it in this life at one time or other.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. A miraculous faith is, when a man believes that ſome extraordinary thing ſhal be affected either by himſelf or others; or that ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing ſhal come to paſs, for which he hath ſome ſpecial promiſe or revelation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.9. Now the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this faith is rather from the ground of it (to wit, the ſpecial promiſe or revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) then from the gift it ſelf. Of its own nature ſimply, it comes ſhort of receiving and applying Chriſt; as is evident by this reaſon, Becauſe it may be in a Reprobate: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119999:106"/>Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Divels, and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The ſecond kind of faith is an Hiſtorical faith, and that is a bare aſſent (and no more) to the truth of the Scriptures; a believing that the Scriptures are true, without reſting on them, or affecting of them. Now that this faith is too ſhort to the purpoſe aforeſaid, is plain, becauſe it is to be found in the very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels themſelves, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19 <hi>The Divels believe and tremble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third kind of faith is a Temporary faith: Now this kind of faith goes beyond the Hiſtorical in two degrees: Firſt, In that with knowledge and aſſent is joined ſuch a profeſſion of the truth as carries a ſhew and form of Godlineſs, as we may ſee in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Act. 8.13. <hi>Then Simon himſelf belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alſo, and when he was baptiſed, he continued with Philip, &amp;c.</hi> 2. A kind of rejoycing and glorying in that knowledg, aſſent, and profeſſion: as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>He that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it; yet hath he not root in himſelf, but dureth for a while.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 5.35. our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119999:106"/>ſpeaking to the Jews of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining light, and ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoice in his light.</hi> But this faith being not a well rooted faith, at the length it vaniſheth away and comes to nothing, and therefore called a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary faith; and being not well rooted, it is too ſhort likewiſe for the buſineſs aforeſaid, is not able in a found and kindly way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth kind of faith is a Juſtifying faith: ſo called becauſe it apprehends that which doth juſtifie, to wit, Chriſt. It is likewiſe called a Sanctifying faith, becauſe it purifieth the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>Purifying their hearts by faith:</hi> and ſo a ſaving faith, becauſe the end of it is ſalvation, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.9 <hi>Receiving the end of your faith, even the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your ſouls.</hi> Now this faith, as it hath many effects beyond the other kinds of faith, ſo likewiſe it comprehends them all; as the Hiſtorical, and Temporary, why ſo the miraculous faith; for he that hath Juſtifying faith, if ſo be he had any extraordinary revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſpecial promiſe made unto him, hee could as well lay hold upon them as upon that Revelation and thoſe Promiſes he doth lay hold upon. And if you ask me what this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith is? I anſwer, It is that grace
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119999:107"/>of Gods Spirit, whereby a man of a contrite and humble ſpirit is enabled to receive Chriſt and his benefits. Not but that this faith hath other effects, and a larger extent; but yet this is a principal effect of it. Thus we have found out the faith that will ſerve the turne.</p>
                  <p>We come now in the ſecond place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire wherein the nature and Eſſence of this faith conſiſteth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In four acts of the ſoul, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two being acts of the Underſtanding, the latter two being acts of the Will.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt act is this, to wit, a knowing of Chriſt aright, and that which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel reveals to mankind concerning him.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, I muſt know that Chriſt is an All ſufficient Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I muſt know that he and all his merits are offered by the Lord to me, as well as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I muſt know that Chriſt is ſo offered to me, as I am commanded to believe that he and his merits belong to me. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I muſt know how and upon what terms Chriſt is offered unto me, not only as my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to free me from Gods wrath, and to bring me to heaven; but likewiſe as my Lord and King, to rule and govern me, and I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119999:107"/>and heartily to ſerve and obey him; he being only a Saviour to ſuch, and unto all ſuch: as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>being made perfect, he became</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>the Author of eternall ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto all them that obey him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This knowledg of Chriſt or the Goſpel, is the firſt thing wherein the nature and eſſence of juſtifying faith conſiſteth; it being an excellent grace, and ever having knowledg concurring to the being of it; and hence it is, that ſometimes this faith is called the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt, as <hi>Iſai</hi> 53.11. <hi>By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> (that is, by faith in him) <hi>ſhall my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervant juſtifie many;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternall, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond act of the ſoul, wherein the nature and eſſence of this faith conſiſteth, is the <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>credit</hi> that the mind giveth unto all aforeſaid, as to an undoubted truth; to wit, that Chriſt is indeed an all-ſufficient Saviour, and that God offereth him unto me, commanding me to receive him, and that in this gracious offer he meaneth as he ſaith, and that he and all his merits belong to me, if I will receive him upon thoſe terms the Lord offereth him on. In reſpect of this ſecond propertie, faith is called a beleeving of God,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119999:108"/>as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Abraham beleeved God,</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that beleeveth not God, hath made him a liar.</hi> See <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.32.</p>
                  <p>The third act of the ſoul, wherein the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eſſence of this faith conſiſteth, is the <hi>conſent</hi> that the will giveth to this bleſſed offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel, not only for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, but for the incomparable goodneſſe, and excellency of it; as when the contrite and humble ſoul ſaith not onely, <hi>this is a faithfull ſaying,</hi> but likewiſe <hi>worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners:</hi> And ſuppoſe the beleever (through the ſenſe he hath of his own unworthineſſe) find much reluctancy and doubting, to hinder this act of faith; why yet his ſoul unfainedly deſireth, and longeth to receive Chriſt upon the termes aforeſaid: In reſpect of this propertie, faith is called an hungring and thirſting after Chriſt; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs;</hi> to wit, after Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe: And <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6. <hi>I will give unto him that is a thirſt, of the fountain of the water of life freely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth act of the ſoul wherein the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eſſence of this faith conſiſteth, is a reſting and relying upon Chriſt and him alone for the obtaining of Gods favour, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119999:108"/>eternall life. And indeed this is of all other the chief act of the ſoul in true faith, and that wherein the being and eſſence of it doth briefly conſiſt: In reſpect of this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is called a beleeving in or on Chriſt, or a truſting in Chriſt, or a receiving of Chriſt; as <hi>John</hi> 3.16.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>John</hi> 1.12. Theſe ſeveral phraſes implying one and the ſame thing. Thus we ſee now wherein the nature and eſſence of juſtifying faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</p>
                  <p>But the things following we muſt be put in mind of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there are ſeveral degrees of faith, the ſeveral acts aforeſaid, being (in thoſe that are qualified with this grace) in ſome more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſtrong, in others more dim and weak; I mean, the former knowledg, aſſent, conſent and receiving: Yet the weakeſt faith being a true faith ſerving the turn to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in one and the ſame party, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts aforeſaid are ſometimes more ſtrong, and ſometimes more weak.</p>
                  <p>And 3. That ſome of the acts of faith may be ſtrong, and ſome of them weak in one and the ſame partie, and at one and the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> But may ſome men ſay, Is not this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119999:109"/>likewiſe an act of juſtifying faith to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; or auſſrance of Gods favour, and that Chriſt and his benefits are mine?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Although this aſſurance be attainable, and ſome do attain unto it in this life, to wit, in proceſs of time, after many Trials, and Combats, after many experiences of Gods love, after the practice of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties long continued in, and conſtantly ſtuck unto (for otherwiſe ordinarily it is not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto) why yet there be many, that (no queſtion) have a true and right faith, that do not attain unto it in this life, I mean to this aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This aſſurance is not an act of juſtifying faith, as it juſtifieth; but an act of faith following juſtification, or an act of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in one already juſtified by faith, or a fruit of faith; it being not properly of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eſſence of juſtifying faith. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being thus opened, we come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1 To inform us touching the miſerable condition of divers men and women for the preſent, all ſuch as are not qualified with this faith; no juſtifying faith, no Chriſt; no Chriſt, no ſalvation; and if no ſalvation, what but damnation? Now divers men and women, may it not be concluded of them, that they are altogether deſtitute this way?</p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:119999:109"/>
                  <p>As firſt, all ſuch as are groſly ignorant; faith being a wiſe grace of Gods ſpirit, and preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing knowledg in ſome meaſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All prophane perſons, a juſtifying faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſanctifying faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All ſuch whoſe hearts are not ſhivered and broken in ſome meaſure, in the ſight and ſenſe of their naturall miſerie; contrition and humiliation (ever in thoſe of years) being the uſher to this faith. And the miſery of ſuch is the greater, becauſe either they make no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of this grace, or preſume they have it alreadie, when alas there is no ſuch matter; or think it is impoſſible to attaine unto, or if they ſhould go about it, that it would coſt them too much pains, or bring upon them too much damage, or trouble, by forgoing their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſures, and profits, or expoſing them to dangers and perſecutions; or elſe think it is ſo eaſie a thing to get, as they may obtain it when they will, and ſo put off the ſeeking of it untill their death beds: well, we ſee all ſuch as are deſtitute of this grace to be for the preſent in a wofull condition: no meaſure of this grace, no benefit by Chriſt; and then woe and alas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2 For trial and examination, whether we be qualified with this grace or no, ſeeing it is of ſuch neceſſity as that without it we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119999:110"/>partake of Chriſt and his Benefits. To this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the faith</hi> (that is, whether a true faith be in you or no) <hi>prove your owne ſelves; know you not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</hi> Now if we ſay we have a Juſtifying faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, How came we by it? How was it wrought in us? Did it come by hearing of the word? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Hath the Law been thy School-maſter to bring thee to Chriſt? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. Hath the miniſtry of the Law effectually diſcovered thy ſins and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition unto thee, and ſo thy heart became contrite and broken? Before Chriſt came into thy heart, did <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> come preparing his way? <hi>Mark</hi> 1.2. This is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way whereby the Lord brings his Elect to faith; before the Goſpel work it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally, the Law prepares unto it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou that ſayeſt thou haſt faith, how haſt thou held it? Hath it not been with doubtings and fears, as the father of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed child; <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.</hi> It is true indeed, that doubting is not of the nature of faith, but juſt contrary unto it; yet there is no faith altogether without doubting, although it
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119999:110"/>cannot be denyed but as faith growes, ſo doubting is expelled. Many will ſay, they never doubted, they thank God: but that ſuch perſons never had faith, I need not doubt to affirm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Weigh we the effects and fruits of this Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will make a man or a woman earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſire after the word: <hi>Job</hi> 23.12. <hi>I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the words of his mouth more then my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary food;</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby. Amos</hi> 8.12. the Believer is deſcribed to be ſuch an one as <hi>runs to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord,</hi> when there is a ſcarcity of it. Such as in the ordinary courſe are indifferent whether they hear the word or no, have an indifferent faith; I mean none, no true faith: and there be abundance of ſuch perſons, like to the Faction in <hi>Corinth,</hi> that gloried they were neither followers of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor of <hi>Apollo,</hi> nor of <hi>Cephas,</hi> but of <hi>Chriſt only.</hi> They would ſeem ſo to depend upon Chriſt, that they cared for never a Preacher of them all, nor regarded to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their Miniſtry: And ſo many men and women at this day, that hope (they ſay) to be ſaved by Chriſt, and yet care not in the leaſt for the Miniſtry of the word;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119999:111"/>but this hope of theirs, is but a vain hope.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond fruit of this faith, it is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Prayers and Supplications; ſo we read of <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſwadling bands of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. <hi>Behold he prayeth.</hi> And <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 86.3. <hi>I cry unto thee daily:</hi> nay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17. <hi>Evening, and Morning, and at noon will I pray, and cry aloud:</hi> And one ſpecial thing Believers pray for is an encreaſe of this grace, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5. <hi>O Lord encreaſe our faith:</hi> So the Apoſtles praied. And <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. the father of the poſſeſſed child cryed out, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief.</hi> There is a great difference betwixt the praying of ſuch as have this grace, and ſuch as have it not. Such as have not this grace, praying eſpecially for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things; and if for Spiritual things, in a lip, cold, careleſſe and carnal way: but the Believer eſpecially for Spiritual things, as before, and from the heart, earneſtly, as <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent fortht he Spirit of his Son onto your hearts, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Abba father,</hi> Epheſ. 6.18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third effect and fruit of this faith is, Sins Mortification in ſome meaſure, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4, 5. This grace <hi>purifies the heart,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9, And this effect of faith is thus grounded.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it applieth all that Chriſt did,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:119999:111"/>and ſuffered, particularly to a man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth his ſoul, that out of his love to him, and care to keep him from periſhing everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly, he endured all that he did endure; as <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me:</hi> and hence the Believer cannot but love Chriſt again, and manifeſt the ſame by ſetting himſelf againſt that which he knowes Chriſt hates, to wit, ſin. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond ground is, Becauſe this Grace <hi>unites a man to Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 15.5. brings Chriſt into the ſoul; now if Chriſt be in the ſoul, ſin muſt needs be weakening and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying: Many pretend faith, but where is the abatement of corruption? See <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.2. <hi>But unto you that fear my name ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his wings:</hi> This Sun did never ariſe and ſhine upon any heart but it brought an healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue with it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth effect of faith, A high eſteem of the godly, be they never ſo poor; and a mean eſteem of the wicked, be they never ſo rich: ſo the Pſalmiſt ſets forth the Believer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. <hi>In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned</hi> (ſuppoſe they be never ſo rich and wealthy) <hi>but he honoureth them that fear the Lord,</hi> be they never ſo mean and poor. Now
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:119999:112"/>many in the ordinary courſe, who are they familiar with but the wicked? and whom do they oppoſe but the godly, and for Godlineſs ſake? Such are far from having any meaſure of this grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth effect and fruit of this faith is, A fear to offend God in any thing. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Happy is the man that feareth alway;</hi> to wit, to offend God: the true Believer is this man. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>There is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee</hi> (ſaith the true Believer to God) <hi>that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and broken hearted ſinner doth no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er believe his ſins to be pardonable through the rich mercy of God in Chriſt, but he fears to offend God in the leaſt thing he knowes to be ſin; and therefore tell ſuch a party that unbelief is a ſin, and that he offends by doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods mercy in Chriſt; Oh how doth he bewail his unbelief, and earneſtly ſtrive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faith.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And laſtly, Although the true Believer may ſometimes doubt whether he hath faith or no, yet he would not part with that faith of his which he ſo queſtions upon any termes, for any thing; and upon deliberation he would not change Eſtates with any Natural man, no not with the beſt Civilliſt: neither would he be in the ſame eſtate he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119999:112"/>for all the world. Thus much for the ſecond Uſe, wherein we have examined the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. To exhort every man and woman to labour for this Faith, ſeeing without it we cannot partake of Chriſt and his Benefits. Many Inducements and Provocations might be thought of this way. As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we weigh the glory they give to God who do believe: <hi>John</hi> 3.33. <hi>He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his Seal, that God is true. Rom.</hi> 4.20. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith giving glory to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we weigh the diſhonour and injury they do to God who do not believe: as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son: and this is the Record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 If we weigh that it is ſuch a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as every man hath not: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>All men have not faith:</hi> Nay, ſuch a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as but a few have, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 If we confider the cloud of examples this way, to wit, of Believers (although but a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:119999:113"/>few comparatively) and what they obtained by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Reaſon is, becauſe thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was never throughly awakened with a diſtinet ſight of thy ſins, and Gods Juſtice purſuing thee for the ſame, thou thinking thou doſt believe in Chriſt all this while, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119999:113"/>alas, thy faith being nothing elſe but preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when thy conſcience comes to be a wakened and to roar in thy face, thou wilt find it the moſt difficult thing in all the world to look beyond the cloud of Juſtice, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Gods mercy, and to reſt on Chriſt for Juſtification and Salvation. Thus far touching the ſecond Member of the fourth Principle.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the third Member of the ſame.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="member">
                  <head>MEMBER III. <hi>Apprehending and applying Chriſt with all his Merits unto himſelf.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis is done by faith, and faith alone, as it is in the former Member. So then the Doctrine is this,</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>It is faith, and faith alone that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends and applies Chriſt and all his merits unto a mans ſelf.</hi> See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace ye are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through faith:</hi> as though the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, it is of the free favour of God, giving Chriſt unto you, that you are ſaved; and the only Inſtrument that apprehends and applies Chriſt and all his merits unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119999:114"/>is faith. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> As though faith and faith only were the Inſtrument to lay hold on Chriſt and his merits. But take that place for all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>We conclude, that a man is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith without the deeds of the Law;</hi> faith being the only inſtrument that apprehends and applies Chriſt to Juſtification. So alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The Ground or Reaſon is, Becauſe there is no other eye nor hand for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but this; not that this faith is alone, but ever accompanied with love and other Graces: as the eye in the head is not alone without other ſenſes, yet it only ſeeth, and no other ſenſe beſides it. Love indeed claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth Chriſt and cleaveth unto him, but it is for that which faith firſt diſcerneth to be in him, Chriſt being firſt the object of our Faith, and then the object of our Love; and to ſpeak properly, faith is the eye and hand of the ſoul, and love only the hand of faith; for ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of theſe Graces, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth nothing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the illuſtrating of this Doctrine, we propound theſe Queſtions. Firſt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119999:114"/>Faith or Love be the more excellent Grace? Secondly, Whether Juſtifying faith in the exerciſe of it, be not of a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then aforeſaid? do not as well embrace the whole word of God, as apprehend and apply Chriſt and his merits?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether Faith or Love be the more excellent Grace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In ſome reſpects the Grace of Love is more excellent then the Grace of Faith. Firſt, It is more conſpicuous and viſible, Faith being ſecret and inward (but yet by Love diſcovering it ſelfe.) Secondly, It is more beneficial and commodious, Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hand whereby a man receives for himſelf; but Love being the hand whereby a man reacheth out to others. Thirdly, It is of longer continuance: 1 <hi>Corinth,</hi> 13.8. <hi>Love never faileth:</hi> And in this reſpect the Apoſtle prefers it to Faith and Hope, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Now abideth Faith, Hope, Love, thoſe three, but the greateſt of theſe is Love:</hi> The exerciſe of Faith and Hope ceaſing, when Love ſhall be in the greateſt exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>Now in other reſpects faith doth excel Love: As firſt, It juſtifies a man before God, and ſo doth not Love; I mean, is the inſtrument that way, but ſo is not Love. 2. Faith (if
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119999:115"/>we ſpeak in regard of exerciſe) is the Cauſe, and Love is the Effect; now the Cauſe is more excellent then the Effect. 3. What do we reach forth by Love which we have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Now we come to the ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether Juſtifying Faith do not as well believe the whole Word of God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and apply Chriſt and his Merits? Whether the Office of it be only reſtrained to Juſtifying?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although Chriſt and his Merits be the principal Object of this Faith; why, yet the ſame faith which receiveth Chriſt, and reſteth on him, and ſo juſtifies, believes all the other promiſes made of God in Chriſt unto Believers, whether they concern this life or the life to come; nay, believes the whole Word of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.14. as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, threatnings, &amp;c. This Faith not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeilding a bare aſſent unto whatſoever is delivered in the Scriptures (as concerning the truth of it) but likewiſe moving and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the affections according to the nature of the matter believed, whether Promiſes, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, or threatnings. Now we come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To inform us how excellently they are furniſhed unto whom the Lord hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:119999:115"/>this qualification, it being the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the only inſtrument that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends and applies Chriſt and his Merits. Now we are to know, that as there be very many who think they have this Grace of Faith, and yet have it not; why ſo there be ſome who have it, and yet fear they have it not. The latter of theſe we deſire to encounter with, by anſwering ſome of their Objections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. We ſhall have ſome Chriſtians to ſay, That it is true indeed, they make a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Faith in a ſpecial manner, and they dearly love Gods Word. Gods Miniſters, and Gods People, and earneſtly deſirous they are in every thing to pleaſe God; but they do not know when, or by whom they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and therefore they queſtion whether they have the grace of true faith, or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Although ſome of Gods people know and can remember the time and inſtrument this way, why yet this is not required of all Gods people. The Lord converting ſome even byone Sermon, others by degrees, and in a longer time, as he beſt pleaſes. May it not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to find this Faith by the effects of it, but we muſt trouble our ſelves about unneceſſary circumſtances? See what the man that was born blind ſaith in the like caſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But may ſome men ſay, My faith
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119999:116"/>is ſo little, if any, that I know not what to ſay; I have many fears and doubtings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, that a great and ſtrong faith is earneſtly to be laboured for in the uſe of all good means.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſtronger a mans faith is, the more firme and cloſe his union is with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The clearer apprehenſion he hath of the pardon of his ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The more boldly he goes to the Throne of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The more patiently he endures afflictions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The more conſcionably he walks in his particular Calling.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The more manfully he fights with all his Spiritual enemies; upon theſe grounds ſuch as have but a weak and little faith muſt earneſtly labour to have it ſtronger, and greater; but yet in the mean time theſe parties muſt not be too much diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Firſt, Becauſe there may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feares and doubtings where there is true faith. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.26. and 14.31. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It is not the excellency and great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith that juſtifies us, but the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith; to wit, Chriſt and his Merits. Thirdly, A weak faith, (if a true faith) doth apprehend this object effectually,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119999:116"/>and ſavingly, as a little hand may hold a jewel of ineſtimable worth, and a palſie hand a gift of great price: He that did look upon the braſen ſerpent in the wilderneſſe but with one eye; nay but with half an eye, was as well and fully cured of the deadly ſting of the fiery ſerpent as thoſe which beheld it with both eyes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſtrongeſt faith in this world is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe, the father of the faithful, had his doubtings, as when he took <hi>Hagar</hi> and requeſted <hi>Sarah</hi> to ſay <hi>ſhe was his Siſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> 3 I have but a little ſenſe and feeling, but a little aſſurance of Gods favour, and of the pardon of my ſins, and therefore I ſuſpect the truth of my faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true indeed, that this feeling and aſſurance is earneſtly to be endeavored after by every godly perſon. Firſt, Becauſe it is a glimpſe of heaven, a kind of heaven upon earth. Secondly, Becauſe it makes a mam nimble and chearfull in all manner of obedience active and paſſive; as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> and Heb. 10.34. <hi>Ye took joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing that ye have in heaven a better and enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> But yet we are to know, that this feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſurance is rather an effect of juſtifying
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:119999:117"/>faith, then juſtifying faith it ſelf; and that juſtifying faith may be, and is in many in whom this aſſurance is not, as is plain by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers examples. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Here was faith in <hi>David, my God, my God;</hi> but where was his feeling, when he ſaith, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and ſo <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite, Pſal.</hi> 88.14. <hi>Lord, why caſteſt thou off my ſoul? why hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou thy face from me?</hi> Here was but a little feeling, a little aſſurance; and yet faith to be found in this party, as is plain in the firſt verſe of the ſame Pſalm, <hi>O Lord God of my ſalvation, I have cried day and night before thee.</hi> And ſo <hi>Job.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine enemy?</hi> and 16.9. <hi>He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me; he gnaſheth upon me with his teeth, mine enemy ſharpneth his eyes upon me:</hi> What feeling was here, but of Gods anger? yet take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the faith that was in this man, chap. 13. ver. 15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> The truth of it is, there is a double cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, the certainty of adherence, and the certainty of evidence: the certainiy of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is the certainty of faith, the certainty of evidence is the certainty of aſſurance. Now there may be the former certainty, adhering and cleaving to Chriſt by faith, where there is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:119999:117"/>not the latter, the certainty of evidence and aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Thou that art ready to conclude, thou haſt no faith, becauſe thou haſt ſo little feeling of Gods favour; do but for thy faith, examine it by other effects of it, as love to Gods Word, Gods Miniſters, Gods People, thy earneſt deſire to pleaſe God in all things, and thou maieſt find it; which if thou doſt, thou mayeſt perceive Gods ſpeciall love to thee in ſo excellent a qualification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But I have waited long in the uſe of holy means, and yet have not attained to the bleſſing aforeſaid; and therefore I queſtion whether I have a kindly faith or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, We muſt not appoint God the time when to beſtow his bleſſings upon us, but muſt ſtil wait his time in the uſe of means, ſutable to the bleſſings propounded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we do ill to conclude upon this ground, that we have no faith; we ſhould rather conclude hence, that the Lord for the preſent ſees not this bleſſing good for us; I tell you, every one of Gods people at every time cannot weild the ſenſe of his favour, and the feeling of his love, but through corruption are apt to grow proud, or careleſſe in the uſe of the means.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The longer we have waited, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119999:118"/>do wait, the more plentful wil the conſolation be when it comes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It may be the Lord makes us to wait for it, to kindle our affections unto it, and that we might the more prize it when we have it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It may be to correct our conceit that was in us before our regeneration, in the daies of peace and ſecuritie, before our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences were awakened, we thinking it an eaſie thing to obtain the aſſurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and ſins remiſſion; for ſo many a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man thinks.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Did not the Lord wait long upon us for our contrition and humiliation? and will we murmur at him if we wait long upon him in the uſe of means for comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. But I cannot find my ſelf to come on in grace, in holy deſires and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but corruption to be more and more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in me; and therefore I fear whether I have a true faith or no?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it may be thou doſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the means in a lively and conſtant way, and it may be this thine own fault, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too willing to live under an unprofitable miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be, thou doſt not judge
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119999:118"/>aright of thy own caſe: There be times, when the true Chriſtian is not a competent judg of his own ſpiritual eſtate: as when the humor of melancholly is big and boiſterous in him, or when his brain is crazie through ſome long or violent ſickneſſe, or he is much overgone with trouble of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is it not the daily grief of thy ſoul that thou comeſt on no more in grace, and that corruption is ſo lively in thee? why then ſurely thou groweſt in the root, although not in the bloſsome.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To be ſenſible of corruption, is a ſigne of a living ſoul, which cannot be without a true faith.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The more thou ſeeſt corruption, the leſſe it is; becauſe in ſeeing it, thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it: it matters not ſo much what is in us, as what good; not what corruptions, as how we ſtand affected to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 6. But I obſerve others to outſtrip me, who began profeſſion long after I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; and therefore I ſuſpect the truth of my faith,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, If thou meaneſt by growth,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119999:119"/>gifts, as memory to carry away a Sermon, ability to confer of the Points of Religion, and to pray in a Methodical and enlarged way: Thou art to know that natural parts and powers, and ſo education, doth much in all external exerciſes of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To have a humble opinion of our ſelves, and a high opinion of other Chriſtians is good, but yet we muſt take heed of wronging the work of Gods grace in our ſelves; ſo highly thinking of others Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to conclude our ſelves to have none.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If thou obſerve others indeed to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip thee (beginning profeſſion after thee) take notice of them to be more diligent in the uſe of the Means; thou that ſhouldſt have been an example to them, do not thou diſdain (they having got before thee) now willingly to imitate them.</p>

And for thy comfort, weigh the places following, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that ſearcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the ſpirit, becauſe he maketh interceſsion for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi> And Pſal. 102.19, 20. <hi>He hath looked down from the height of his Sanctuary; from Heaven did the Lord behold the earth, to hear the groaning of the Priſoner;</hi> And Pſal. 10.17. <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble.</hi> And ſo Pſal. 145.19. <hi>He will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the deſire of them that fear him.</hi> Nay, Pſal. 77.4. <hi>I am ſo troubled that I cannot ſpeak;</hi> and yet breathing out prayer as well he could: ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of the ſame Pſalm, <hi>I cryed unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice, and he gave ear unto me.</hi> And ſo <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſai. 38.14. <hi>Like a crane or a ſwallow, ſo did I chatter;</hi> but this chatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his had a gracious effect, as we may ſee in the verſes following.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Such as have not this grace, to labour for it; it being the Inſtrument, and the onely Inſtrument that apprehends and applies Chriſt and all his Merits; nay, that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without which we cannot make uſe of any promiſe made unto the Flect; and get this grace, and get every grace. It is true, Gods Spirit muſt work this grace in us, if it be wrought; yet we muſt uſe the means: But of that in the next Principle, where we have the means of faith laid down.</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:119999:121"/>
                  <p n="2">2. To exhort all ſuch as have even the leaſt meaſure of this grace, to make uſe of it: Is it the Inſtrument whereby we apprehend and apply Chriſt, and all his Merits unto our own ſouls? Oh let us make uſe of it this way, often in the uſe of holy means be applying him, and bringing him near unto our ſouls; reſting upon him for pardon and juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not onely hold forth our faith to the promiſe of pardon, and forgiveneſs in and through Chriſt, but extend it unto all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes made of God in Chriſt Jeſus unto Believers, as we may have occaſion; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they concern this life, or the life to come; be they general, or particular; abſolute, or conditional; expreſs, or implicite. This ſhould be the wiſdome of the Believer, as to acquaint himſelf with the whole word of God, and to be affected with it alwayes, as it applyes it ſelf unto him, (for this faith doth not onely extend it ſelf to the promiſes, but to the whole word of God, as the Precepts, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſo eſpecially to acquaint himſelf with the precious promiſes diſperſed here and there in the Sacred Scriptures. Then 2. To have them in memory by frequent mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3. Often to urge them upon God in Prayer. And 4. Ever to reſt upon them as he hath occaſion. This is to live by our
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:119999:121"/>faith, and this is that which is ever injoyned us in holy writ, to wit, the act and exerciſe of our faith; the habit of faith being the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on Gods part, and the act and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of faith, the Covenant on our part; not but that men and women muſt uſe all holy means for the habit, and not that the habit can act without the effectual concurrence of Gods Spirit, exciting, and co-working. Now touching this life of faith, we will not think much (for your better proceeding therein) to give inſtance in ſome particular caſes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As firſt, Art thou at any time oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the weight and burden of thy ſins? call to mind the promiſes of pardon, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs made unto ſuch a ſoul; as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.18. <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> And the 55 of the ſame Propheſie, verſe 7. <hi>Let the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> And ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> In the caſe aforeſaid, ſuch promiſes as theſe muſt be reviewed, meditated on, urged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119999:122"/>God in Prayer, and then reſted on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond inſtance. Doſt thou at any time find corruption ſtrong and grace weak in thee? call to mind the promiſes of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or of help theſe wayes; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins</hi> (that is, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the guilt, but likewiſe from the power of ſin;) And <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>This ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael: After thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 44.2. <hi>I will pour water upon him that is thirſty; and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon thy Seed, and my bleſſing upon thy Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</hi> And ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgements and do them.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like Promiſes thou muſt review, meditate on, urge upon God in Prayer, and reſt on them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third inſtance. Doſt thou doubt thy perſeverance, and holding out to the end? ſee <hi>John</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt;</hi> (that is, ſhall never after be altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of grace) <hi>but the water that I ſhall give
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119999:122"/>him, ſhall be in him a Well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> And the fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Goſpel, verſe 24. <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto you, He that believeth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> And ſo the tenth Chapter, verſes 27, 28, 29. <hi>My ſheep hear my voyce, and I know them, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me; and I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand: My Father which gave them me is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.</hi> Theſe Promiſes, and ſuch like, in the caſe aforeſaid, muſt be called to mind, meditated on, urged upon God in Prayer, &amp; ſo reſted on.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth inſtance. Doſt thou at any time fear the ſupply of Temporal things? ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>The yong Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger; but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> And <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84.11. <hi>He will give grace, and glory, and no good thing wil he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> And ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Let your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have; for he hath ſaid, I
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119999:123"/>will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Theſe Promiſes, and the like, in the caſe aforeſaid, muſt be thought of, urged upon God in Prayer, and reſted on.</p>
                  <p>The laſt inſtance I lay forth at this time. The times being evil, Doſt thou fear greater afflictions to befal thee, then thou ſhalt be enabled patiently to bear? ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10. <hi>There ſhall no evil befal thee.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>We know that all things</hi> (even afflictions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) <hi>work together for good, unto them that love God.</hi> Theſe places promiſe that no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction hurtful ſhall befal thee; nay, that no affliction ſhall befal thee, but for thy good: And ſee further, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.19. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them out of them all.</hi> This place, and ſuch places as this, promiſe unto thee a good iſſue unto thy afflictions; nay, to anſwer thy fear. See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee;</hi> to wit, ſupporting, and ſuſtaining thee. And 1 <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able.</hi> Theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſuch like, in the caſe aforeſaid, muſt be reviewed, meditated on, urged upon God in Prayer, and then reſted on. And ſo in all other caſes, as thou mayeſt have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thou ſhalt find promiſes in holy Writ
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119999:123"/>to fit thee; acquaint thy ſelf with them, meditate on them, urge them upon God in Prayer, reſt on them, ſerve Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the uſe of all lawful means ſutable, and often conſider of Gods Attributes, the props of faith; as his Wiſdome, Power, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Truth; and this is to make uſe of faith, to live by our faith. And ſo farre touching the third Member of the fourth Principle. Now we come to the fourth Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer thereof.</p>

                  <p>IN which Member, and the Member fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the Catechiſme acquaints us with two ſpecial benefits, that the true Believer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by Chriſt; to wit, Juſtification, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. Now as touching this Member, we commend unto you this point of Doctrine:</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>Every man that apprehends and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes Chriſt and his Merits unto himſelf, by a kindly faith, is juſtified before God;</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> That is to ſay, Every one lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on Chriſt by a true faith, is a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſon. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith;</hi> that is, by faith apprehending, and applying Chriſt and his Merits; for ſo onely
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119999:124"/>faith juſtifies. And the ſame Chap. verſe 18. <hi>As by the offence of one,</hi> (to wit <hi>Adam</hi>) <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one,</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>the free gift came upon all men</hi> (that is to ſay, all true Believers) <hi>unto juſtification.</hi> Compare this with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, 30. And ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you, men and brethren, that through this man</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins; and by him, all that believe are juſtified.</hi> Now we come to the grounds or Reaſons of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Whatſoever the true Believer ſhould be, ſhould do, ſhould ſuffer, Chriſt was, did, and ſuffered for the true Believer; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth:</hi> that is, Let the Law come upon the true Believer which way it will, he may anſwer it in the compleat obedience of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The obedience of Chriſt, which is the material cauſe of juſtification, was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of ſuch a perſon, as was not onely man, but God; and therefore ſufficient, and more then ſufficient for the juſtifying of all true Believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. This is the end of Chriſts obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in Gods eternal Councel and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to wit, the juſtifying of true Believers,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119999:124"/>that all true Believers might be juſtified by it; as <hi>Romans</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſent forth</hi> (or fore-ordained) <hi>to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. So many as are true Believers; have that inſtrument or hand, which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends and applyes Chriſt, and the Merit of his obedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nce unto themſelves for juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for ſo faith onely juſtifies, not as a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or act, but as an inſtrument or hand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt and his Merits.</p>
                  <p>But that we may the better ſee into a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſo great conſequence we intend to anſwer the queſtions following 1. Wherein this juſtification conſiſts. 2. What it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defined. 3. The difference betwixt it and ſanctification.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Wherein this juſtification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It conſiſts, 1. in remiſſion of ſins. 2. In imputation of Righteouſneſs; as we may ſee, <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.24. (this benefit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken of) there is mention made, as of <hi>reconciliation for iniquity,</hi> ſo of <hi>an everlaſting Righteouſneſs.</hi> And <hi>Zachariah</hi> 3.4. <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Joſhua</hi>) <hi>I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſs from thee, and I will cloath thee with change of raiment.</hi> And ſo 2 <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119999:125"/>who knew no ſin, that we might be the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him.</hi> And however the Scriptures do ſometimes ſeem to place juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in remiſſion of ſinnes, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8.) why yet the other part, to wit, imputation of Righteouſneſs, is alwayes implyed, and to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2 What juſtification is, and how to be defined?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is that gracious ſentence of God, whereby (for Chriſts Merits) he abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the true Believer from all his ſinnes, and the puniſhment due for them; and whereby he accounteth him Righteous unto life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                  <p>A little to open the definition: Firſt, we ſay, that juſtification is a <hi>[ſentencing,]</hi> or <hi>pronouncing of ſentence;</hi> and ſo the word uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſignifies in Scripture; it is a judicial term, taken from the Bench of the Judge, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies (by way of ſentence) to pronounce a perſon Arraigned to be clear, innocent, and Righteous, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> 2. We call it <hi>[that gracious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God]</hi> becauſe it was of Gods free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to find out a remedy for poor ſinners, to give Chriſt the material and Meritorious Cauſe of juſtification, to give faith whereby
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119999:125"/>to apprehend and apply Chriſt and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We go on in the definition, <hi>[Whereby for Chriſts Merits:]</hi> that is to ſay, for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his obedience, Paſſive, and Active; the Lord doth not ſo ſhew mercy, as to wrong his Juſtice, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. [He abſolveth the true Believer from all his ſinnes:]</hi> That is to ſay, not onely paſt, but to come in a manner, to wit, vertually; ſins paſt being pardoned in themſelves, ſins to come, in the Subject, or Party ſinning; as <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> It followeth, <hi>[And the puniſhment due for them:]</hi> The Cauſe being taken away, the Effect muſt needs be removed; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> to wit, neither Eternal, nor Temporal.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond part of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>[And whereby he accounteth him righteous:]</hi> That is, for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed unto him; according unto that ſtyle given Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs. [<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto life eternal:]</hi> This
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119999:126"/>being annexed (to wit, life eternal) unto the righteouſneſs aforeſaid. Hence it is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>The juſtification of life.</hi> Thus far touching the definition of juſtification. Now we come to the third queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. What's the difference betwixt juſtification and ſanctification?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although it be true, that juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification be alwayes inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the perſon juſtified being ever ſanctified; why yet there be theſe differences following betwixt them:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The righteouſneſs of ſanctification, is a righteouſneſs <hi>inherent in our ſelves;</hi> I mean, a work wrought within us by the Spirit of God; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you.</hi> But the righteouſneſs of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a righteouſneſs <hi>without us,</hi> inherent in Chriſt, imputed to us; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience,</hi> (to wit <hi>Adams) many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one,</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> It is true indeed, this righteouſneſs of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is received by faith inherent in us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The righteouſneſs of ſanctification is not wrought in the <hi>ſame meaſure and degree</hi> in all true Believers. A man may have grace, and true grace, and yet come far ſhort of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in grace; as is evident, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.23. <hi>He
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119999:126"/>that received ſeed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and underſtandeth it, which alſo beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, ſome an hundred, ſome ſixty, ſome thirty.</hi> And although this difference, yet all good ground; and this we may ſee in <hi>Hanani,</hi> who is deſcribed <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.2. to <hi>fear God above many;</hi> to wit, that he did truly fear God. And ſo in <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1. verſe 8. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the earth?</hi> But the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of juſtification is equally vouchſafed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every true Believer, without any difference at all; every true Believer is as fully diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all his ſins, as any other, is as perfectly righteous in the ſight of God, as any other; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Even the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> (that is to ſay, the righteouſneſs of juſtification) <hi>which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> So then, all true Believers are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſanctified, but equally juſtified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another difference. The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſanctification is wrought in us <hi>not all at once,</hi> but by degrees; hence it is compared <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18. to <hi>the light that ſhineth more and more, unto the perfect day.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. to the body of a man, which growes in ſtature and ſtrength, til it come to the full perfection.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:119999:127"/>But the righteouſneſs of juſtification <hi>is done all at once;</hi> it never groweth and increaſeth at all, but is as much at our firſt ingrafting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, our firſt ingrafting into Chriſt by faith, as it is ever after; as <hi>Romans</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> That is to ſay, to true Believers after they do believe. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith;</hi> (not a little, or in part juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but juſtified:) this faith indeed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we do apprehend it, our ſenſe and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it likewiſe, is not perfected at once, but groweth and increaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another difference. The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſanctification, is never perfected in this life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> But the righteouſneſs of juſtification is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect in this life, <hi>Canticles</hi> 4.7. <hi>Thou art all fair, my Love,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Church in regard of her juſtification) <hi>there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> Though in reſpect of our ſanctification, we be not throughly cleanſed from all our ſinnes; yet in reſpect of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication we are; according unto that, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt, his Son, cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us from all ſinne:</hi> the Lord accounting of the true Believer, as though there were no ſinne in him, and as though he were
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119999:127"/>perfectly righteous. And hence it is, that Gods people do (and may do) more bear themſelves, and reſt upon their juſtification, then upon their ſanctification. Thus we ſee the difference, or differences betwixt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſanctification; and ſo we have reſolved the third queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But before we come to the Application, we are to anſwer ſome objections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If this be a truth undeniable, that all true Believers are juſtified perſons (for that is the effect of the Doctrine,) How comes it to paſs then, that they daily pray for remiſſion of ſinnes? What need have they to do do ſo, remiſſion of ſinnes being the chief part of juſtification?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Firſt in general. That they have need to do ſo, is plain, becauſe our Saviour commands them this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.11, 12. <hi>Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts,</hi> (that is to ſay, our ſinnes:) As our Saviour would have all true Believers daily to put up and renew the Petition for Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, why ſo likewiſe the Petition for ſinnes remiſſion: Now, were not this needful for them, our Saviour would not have injoyned them it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. More particularly, divers Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be given why it is neceſſary
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:119999:128"/>for true Believers, daily to put up this ſuit. 1. Hereby a ſenſe of ſinnes deſert, and of their own unworthineſſe is nouriſhed in them, which is very behoofeful, even for the beſt, ſo long as they are in this vale of tears. 2. They ſinne daily, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt put up this requeſt daily; ſinne being not every way actually pardoned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be repented of, and pardon of it intreated. 3. A man may be a juſtified perſon, and yet have little aſſurance of Gods favour and ſinnes remiſſion; this is the way to gain aſſurance, more and more aſſurance. 4. Suppoſe a man have great aſſurance of Gods favour, and ſinnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, why yet it is his duty to beg the continuance of Gods favour, and that the pardon of his ſinnes may be aſſured him with repentance: We read of many of the Saints in holy Writ, that prayed for that of which they were before aſſured; and thus our Saviour himſelf, although he was aſſured that none of his ſheep ſhould periſh, as in <hi>John,</hi> Chapter 10. verſe 28. <hi>I give unto them Eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh:</hi> yet ſee how he prayeth for them, in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter verſe 11. <hi>Now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:119999:128"/>Father, keep through thine owne Name thoſe whom thou haſt given me.</hi> Thus the firſt objection is anſwered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But if all true Believers be juſtified perſons, and juſtification doth not onely abſolve from all ſinne but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from all puniſhment: How comes it to paſſe then, that the Lord doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict ſo many puniſhments upon Believers?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although all the miſeries and afflictions of this life, be in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhments for ſinne, becauſe they are all fruits of ſinne, ſinne firſt bringing them into the world; why yet are they not puniſhments to all men, as is evident by the two Reaſons following:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God inflicteth no puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any man, but for ſinne; but there be many great judgements and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Lord layes upon Believers, wherein he hath no reſpect at all to their ſinnes, as to the cauſe of theſe judgements; he not intending therein as a Judge in a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative manner to correct them for any ſin; and the truth of this we may ſee in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: <hi>Job</hi> (we know) was a man, that ſometimes had many miſeries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities upon him, inſomuch that his friends cenſured him guilty of ſome great
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119999:129"/>ſin or ſins as the cauſe of theſe judgements: But the Lord reproves them for this their cenſure, as men not rightly underſtanding his ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> neither the manner of his proceeding with his ſervants, as we may ſee Job 42.7. <hi>The Lord ſaid to Eliphaz the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manite, My wrath is kindled againſt thee, and againſt thy two friends; for ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant Job hath.</hi> And what doth the Lord ſay unto Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evil, and ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity, although thou movedſt me againſt him to ſwallow him up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, may you ſay, Had not <hi>Job</hi> ſin enough in him to deſerve as much as he endured? Yes no queſtion. Why then doth the Lord ſay, that Satan moved him to ſwallow up <hi>Job</hi> without cauſe? Surely his meaning is, that there was nothing in <hi>Job</hi> that was the cauſe whereby God was moved thus to afflict him; he did not therein puniſh his ſin, there were other cauſes of it, to wit, that by this tryal of his he might make him a pattern and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of faith and patience unto the Church for ever. And we know what our Saviour
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119999:129"/>ſaith to <hi>Peter,</hi> John 21.18 <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, when thou waſt young thou gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelf, and walkedſt whither thou wouldeſt; but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands and another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldſt not.</hi> Shall we ſuppoſe now that our Saviours meaning was thus, <hi>Peter,</hi> when thou comeſt to be old, will the Lord correct thee for thy ſins? No, the the Text cleares this in the next verſe; <hi>This ſpake he ſignifying by what death Peter ſhould glorifie God:</hi> And this is that which our Saviour tells his Diſciples touching the man born blind, <hi>John</hi> 9.3. <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him;</hi> as though he ſhould ſay, neither this mans ſins nor his parents were the cauſe why the Lord ſmote him with blindneſs; but this is the cauſe, to wit, <hi>That the works of God might be made manifeſt in him.</hi> This is the firſt Reaſon to prove that Judgments and afflictions are not puniſhments to all men, the Lord ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inflicting them upon Believers, without any reſpect at all to their ſins as the cauſe of them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, The Judgments the Lord inflicteth upon Believers for their ſins are not properly to be accounted and called pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:119999:130"/>but fatherly chaſtiſements and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections only. For all puniſhments (to ſpeak properly) that God inflicteth upon any for ſin, are cauſes and fruits of his wrath, wherein he ſeeketh not the good of the party puniſhed, but the glorifying of his own Juſtice upon him, and the ſatisfying of his moſt righteous Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But firſt, All the afflictions of Believers are unto them Bleſſings and not curſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (that is to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Believer,) <hi>whom thou chaſtiſeſt, O Lord;</hi> and <hi>James</hi> 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever) <hi>that endureth temptation,</hi> that is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are fruits of Gods ſpecial love to them, and not of his wrath. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth:</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ſeeketh their good in and by theſe afflictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good</hi> (even afflictions themſelves) <hi>unto them that love God:</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>But when we are judged</hi> (that is afflicted) <hi>we are chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi> This is the ſecond Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119999:130"/>to prove that judgments and afflictions are not puniſhments to all men; when inflicted upon Believers for their ſins, they are fatherly chaſtiſements and corrections only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. You ſay, that Juſtification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in remiſſion of ſins, and imputation of righteouſneſs; but how can it be that one man ſhould be juſtified by the righteouſneſs of another, by that righteouſneſs which is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in another?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The righteouſneſs of Chriſt was the righteouſneſs of ſuch a perſon as was not only man, but God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. and ſo of infinite merit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Why may not Chriſts righteouſneſs be imputed to all true Believers, as well as <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin imputed to his whole poſterity? which the Apoſtle plainly tells us <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>HEre we have the latter benefit which the true Believer receives by Chriſt, to wit, <hi>Sanctification.</hi> And for the handling of it, we commend unto you this point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</p>
                  <p>Doctr. <hi>Such perſons as truly apprehend and apply Chriſt and his merits unto themſelves, are not only Juſtified, but Sanctified.</hi> Or thus, <hi>Juſtification and Sanctification are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable.</hi> The truth of this we may obſerve in the coupling together of the two laſt Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12, 13. <hi>Forgive us our debts</hi> (or <hi>treſpaſſes) as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> The former Petition being for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; the later for Sanctification. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the five firſt Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> having handled the Doctrine of Juſtification, preſently in the beginning of the ſixth Chapter he falls upon
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:119999:135"/>the Doctrine of Sanctification. And do but ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 11. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1 <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> that is to ſay, every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is juſtified, and ſo likewiſe ſanctified, if we heed that which followes; <hi>who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> And <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity;</hi> to wit, juſtify us: and not that he might ſanctify us too? Yes; ſee further, <hi>and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> Now we come to the Reaſons or Grounds of the Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 From the purity which is in God: he will have his Elect like unto himſelfe, to reſemble himſelf in Holineſſe, to be <hi>holy as he is holy:</hi> his <hi>pity</hi> moveth him to <hi>juſtifie</hi> them, his <hi>purity</hi> to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2 The bloud of Chriſt: which is not only meritorious and effectual to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but likewiſe meritorious and effectual to Sanctification; as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.14 <hi>How much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Such perſons as are juſtified, have
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119999:135"/>faith; now faith is a part of Sanctification: Nay further, where this grace of faith is, there likewiſe are all other Sanctifying Graces.</p>
                  <p>But for the better conceiving of the Point in hand, we propound the Queſtions following 1 What Sanctification is? 2 Whence it is? 3 The degrees of Sanctification? 4 The parts of it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What Sanctification is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a change wrought in a man or woman, whereby corruption is mortifyed, and the ſpecial Image of God reſtored.</p>
                  <p>A little to open this Deſcription. I ſay <hi>[It is a change wrought in a man or woman.]</hi> To diſtinguiſh it from meer civility or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace; common grace only repreſſing and reſtraining corruption, and reforming ſome outward actions. We go on, <hi>[Whereby corruption is mortified:]</hi> that is to ſay, the evil quality or diſpoſition adhering to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral faculties of the ſoul and members of the body is weakened, decayed, purged, and in the end aboliſhed. We go on <hi>[And the ſpecial image of God reſtored:]</hi> We call grace the ſpecial image of God, becauſe the ſoul it ſelf (in a general ſenſe) is the image of God: and the ſpecial image of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; that is to ſay, a rectifyed and a holy
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:119999:136"/>quality and diſpoſition infuſed, and put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every faculty of ſoul, and member of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; that holy quality renewed which in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fall was loſt. Thus we ſee what Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2 Whence is it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Negatively, not from earthly parents; no, although holy. <hi>John</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on his name; which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> It is true indeed, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren deſcending of godly parents are holy in the Churches eſteem, and account; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and that the parents holineſs may be an occaſion and means of the childrens holineſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5, &amp; 3.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 We anſwer Affirmatively, from Chriſt: Joh 1.16 <hi>Of his fulneſs</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10 <hi>We are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that is to ſay, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in Chriſt Jeſus. And from Chriſt two wayes. 1 As the <hi>Author of it: Revel.</hi> 3 14 <hi>Theſe things, ſaith the Amen, the faithful and true witneſs, the beginning of the Creation of God:</hi> Now he that is ſpoken of in this place is Chriſt: and by <hi>Creation</hi> here we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:119999:136"/>
                     <hi>Sanctification,</hi> of which Chriſt is ſaid to be the beginner. 2 As the <hi>Matter and root</hi> out of which it ſprings; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30 <hi>Ye are of him in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification:</hi> And hence it is that the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are ſaid, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30) to be <hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh.</hi> Not that we do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Father and the Holy Ghoſt in this work; the Son ſanctifyeth by meriting San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; the Holy Ghoſt by working it; the Father by ſending his Son to merit, and giving his Spirit to work it. Now we come to the third Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3 What are the degrees of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although Juſtification hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, why yet Sanctification hath: And hence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12 &amp;c. tells us of <hi>little children, young men,</hi> and <hi>fathers,</hi> intimating thereby the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of grace that they have who are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. Hence mention is alſo made of <hi>babes</hi> in Chriſt, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13 and <hi>new born babes</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Some having a greater meaſure, and ſome a leſs: and one and the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty growing from a leſſer meaſure to a greater; and they that attain to the moſt grace in this life, are but babes in grace in compariſon of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:119999:137"/>the great meaſure of grace they ſhall have in the life to come. As 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.21. <hi>Little children, keep your ſelves from Idols;</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation being general to all the Regenerate upon earth: Them that before he calls <hi>young men,</hi> and <hi>fathers,</hi> here he calls <hi>little children;</hi> to wit, comparatively, comparing the meaſure of grace they have in this world, with that meaſure they ſhall have in the world to come: And ſo we underſtand the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to compare his little meaſure of grace in this world, with the great meaſure he ſhould have in the world to come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>When I was a child, I ſpake as a child, I underſtood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way childiſh things:</hi> And that this is the ſenſe I have given, is plaine from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. What are the parts of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Sanctification hath two parts; 1 <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification:</hi> 2. <hi>Vivification. Mortification</hi> is that part of Sanctification, whereby the power, tyranny, and ſtrength of Original ſin is weakned and decayed, and by little and little aboliſhed; the ground of this, being the vertue of Chriſts death applyed; the ſame power weakning ſin in us which ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:119999:137"/>him upon the Croſs, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin. Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> the ſecond part of Sanctification is, that whereby the ſpecial image of God, or inherent righteouſneſſe is reſtored; and the foundation of this, is the vertue of Chriſts Reſurrection; the ſame power raiſing us up to newneſs of life, which raiſed him from the dead: as <hi>Pilip.</hi> 3.10. <hi>That I may know him,</hi> (to wit, Chriſt) <hi>and the power of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> Yet this we muſt remember, that both the parts of Sanctification are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this life, the godly (whilſt they are in this world) conſiſting partly of fleſh, and partly of Spirit: And hence it is that their life is a continual conflict, <hi>The fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh,</hi> Calat. 5.17. They aime at perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but have daily need to renew their Repentance. Wee now come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To confute the opinion of divers men and women, who will ſay they are juſtifyed, and believe in Chriſt, and yet they do not at all demonſtrate the ſame by their Sanctification: examine their lives, and it is not the way of holineſs they proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:119999:138"/>but the way of ſin and diſobedience: In their way and courſe they do not turn to God, but from him, as the Lord complains of the obſtinate Jewes, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.33. <hi>They have turned unto me the back and not the face: though I taught them, riſing up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkned to receive inſtruction.</hi> It is ſwearing, prophaning of the Sabbath, uncleanneſs, Drunkenneſs, oppreſſion, defrauding, they delight in, and not the wayes of Gods Teſtimonies. Nay, divers are ſo far from holineſs, as that they cannot away with thoſe that make a ſhew that way: of all people, they cannot brook the forward in Religion, but oppoſe and perſecute them all the wayes they can: Yea, how earneſt againſt the Holy and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, even divers that are of civil converſation? to give us light that there is a great difference betwixt common grace and ſanctifying. Well, let the prophane perſon, and alſo the meer Civiliſt know, that he ſhall dye in his ſin that dyeth not unto his ſin; and that ſo many as are unſanctified are unjuſtifyed. According to that ſaying of our Saviour unto <hi>Peter,</hi> John 13.8. <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For the great comfort and conſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſuch as truly deſire to fear God, this
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:119999:138"/>being a truth, that Juſtification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are inſeparable. The caſe being ſo with the Godly in this world, as that their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is imperfect; the fleſh ever luſting againſt the Spirit, and ſin ever preſent with them when they would do good: Had they no other ground to faſten their Anchor of Hope upon but their Sanctification, it could not hold them faſt enough againſt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts of Satans temptations, but ſeeing that Sanctification (although imperfect) is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of another Righteouſneſſe which is perfect, to wit, Juſtification; this may bear them up and ſupport them. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> finding his Sanctification to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the fleſh to rebel againſt the ſpirit, hee cryes out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> But conſidering of his Juſtification, he comforts himſelf, and <hi>ver.</hi> 25. breaks forth into the praiſes of God, <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> Now then, to make ſure we are Sanctifyed perſons, and therefore Juſtifyed perſons, that we be not deceived in ſo weighty a matter, it ſhall not be amiſs to lay down ſome Marks and Signs of Sanctification. But becauſe Civility and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality do not a little reſemble Sanctity, it may not be unfit in the firſt place to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119999:139"/>them by ſome notes of Difference: and then afterwards to lay down the diſtinct Signes of Sanctification.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Formaliſt (in the ordinary courſe) cares more for the pleaſing of man then for the pleaſing of God, is more for the praiſe of men then of God. The Scribes and Phariſees were notable Formaliſts, and ſee what our Saviour ſaith unto them, and of them: <hi>

The unſanctified
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:119999:141"/>may have a great deal of literall and ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive knowledg: but they have not a jot of ſpiritual and approving knowledg.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſigne of one ſanctified, is <hi>a new quality in the will;</hi> a readineſſe to hear the voice of God in all things and to obey it, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods words; yee therefore hear them not</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to the rebellious Jewes) <hi>becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8.

They manifeſt their love to God by a <hi>love to his children,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi> See <hi>David Pſalm</hi> 16.2.3. <hi>My goodneſſe extendeth not to thee; but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.63. <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</hi> The more holy, the more watchful; the more they obſerve the image of God to ſhine upon any, the more they love them. Such as love not the Saints are not ſanctified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They manifeſt their love to God by an <hi>endeavour of univerſal obedience,</hi> John 14.15. <hi>If ye love me,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> And verſe 21. <hi>He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is</hi> (and he only) <hi>that loveth me:</hi> And therefore ſee what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5. <hi>Oh that my waies were directed to keep thy ſtatutes!</hi> The ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man out of his very love to God, would fain keep his commandments.</p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:119999:142"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, They manifeſt their love to God by a <hi>grief</hi> and heavineſſe when the Lord is at any time <hi>abſent</hi> from them in their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.1. <hi>

Why hideſt thou thy face from me?</hi> Thus we ſee the third ſigne and mark of ſanctification; <hi>a love to God,</hi> and this love manifeſted, as you have heard.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ſigne of ſanctification. <hi>A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual combat betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit; Gal.</hi> 5.17. There may be a combat in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, and is divers times; but that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſeveral faculties, the conſcience and the will; the conſcience terrifying from ſin, the will pulling and haling unto it. Now this is not a combat betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit, but a combat betwixt the fleſh fearing, and the fleſh deſiring; whereas the combat that is in the ſanctified, is in one and the ſame faculty. As for example, the will of the ſanctified perſon drawing two waies at one and the ſame time; the fleſh one way, and the ſpirit another; I mean, corruption one way, and grace another: corruption, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate part drawing to ſin; grace, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part, at one and the ſame time pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:119999:142"/>back. And ſo on the contrary, grace the regenerate part moving to good; but at one and the ſame time the fleſh, corruption pulling back; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19. <hi>The good that I would, I do not; but the evill which I would not, that I do:</hi> And many like paſſages we have in this ſame chapter. And ſo <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh; and theſe are contrary the one to the other; ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> This is an evident mark of grace; for there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be this combat, but there muſt needs be ſanctification.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. For <hi>Exhortation.</hi> And there be two branches of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to exhort all ſuch as are ſanctified, to endeavour a progreſſe, a growth in grace: for as we have heard, although juſtification hath no degrees, why yet ſanctification hath. And therefore ſuch as have grace muſt ever be labouring further degrees. Now to this purpoſe ſome Motives, and Means.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Gods command, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Theſſalonians were a very holy people, and yet 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.10. the Apoſtle would have them to <hi>abound more and more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 2. This will be a demonſtration
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:119999:143"/>to us, that the grace we have is kindly, and of the right ſtamp; it being the nature of true grace ever to deſire the encreaſe of it ſelfe. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.31, 32. <hi>The kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (that is to ſay, the kingdome of grace) <hi>is like to a grain of muſtard ſeed, which a man took, and ſowed in his field, which indeed is the leaſt of all ſeeds; but when it is growen, it is the greateſt among herbs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a tree; ſo that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</hi> And verſe 33. <hi>Another parable ſpake he unto them: The Kingdome of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</hi> And ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13, 14. <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like a Palme tree; he ſhall grow like a Cedar in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon. Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the courts of our God: They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age; they ſhall be fat and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 3. If we do not grow, we go back; and a declining condition is very uncomfortable; what with the dolours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the afflictions outward, which attend ſuch an eſtate. Theſe be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Means</hi> of growth, that is to ſay,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:119999:143"/>ſome inward helps this way, (for as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>outward</hi> means, the next Principle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means</hi> 1. We muſt often by our faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Chriſt to Juſtification: The more we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Gods mercy in Chriſt unto us this way, the more our hearts turn towards him in love and obedience: 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him becauſe he firſt loved us:</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them and roſe again.</hi> The more clearly we apprehend Chriſt our Juſtifyer, the more we find in him to be our Sanctifyer. See <hi>Eph</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means</hi> 2 We muſt often by our faith have recourſe to Gods Promiſes in this kind. The Lord hath made many gracious Promiſes to further us in the way of Sanctification; as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. <hi>I will heal their backſlidings:</hi> And <hi>Rom</hi> 6.14 <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you:</hi> And ſo <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2 <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every one that hath, ſhall be given, and
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:119999:144"/>he ſhall have abundance.</hi> Such Promiſes as theſe we muſt call to mind, and be earneſt with the Lord in Prayer to make them good unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Branch</hi> 2. To exhort all ſuch as are not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to labor for Sanctification. <hi>Motives: Means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="2">2 Weigh and conſider the great love of God in giving his Son to dye for ſinners, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. and wilt not thou ſhew love to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by fighting againſt ſin, which he hates?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Weigh and perpend the great love of Chriſt, who willingly underwent that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death of the Croſs for thy ſins. Now wilt thou nouriſh that which coſt him his life?</p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:119999:145"/>
                  <p>Then as touching <hi>Vivification,</hi> the other part of Sanctification, weigh and perpend Chriſts Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The efficient cauſe of it, to wit, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: And thus think with thy ſelf, If the ſame Spirit which raiſed up Chriſt from the dead dwell in me, he ſhall raiſe up my ſoul from the death of ſin to the life of grace: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your mortal bodies by the Spirit that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you:</hi> and as their mortal bodies at the laſt day, why ſo their ſouls in this world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Meditate upon the end of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, which was, that death might no more have dominion over him, but that he might for ever live to God; which ſhould be thy ſtudy and endeavour, even to live to God in a life of holineſs and Righteouſneſſe, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Knowing that Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him; for in that he died, he died unto ſin once; but in that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, he liveth unto God.

                  <p>Doct. <hi>The preaching of the Word is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ordinary, outward Means for the begetting of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scriptures are very clear this way. Do but ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>That is the word of faith which we preach.</hi> Not only the proper <hi>object</hi> of faith; but alſo the proper <hi>inſtrument</hi> of faith: And ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 14. of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear</hi> (to wit, for the obtaining of faith) <hi>without a Preacher?</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the point in hand, <hi>So then, faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> (to wit, in the ordinary courſe) <hi>by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (that is to ſay, by hearing the Word preached,) <hi>and hearing by the word of God;</hi> that is to ſay, by the ordinance and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. As though the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, Do you ask me, how the hearing of the word preached comes to be the only, ordinary, outward means for the begetting of faith? I anſwer, by the ordinance and appointment of God. Many other places of Scripture come up to the Point in hand; as <hi>Job</hi> 33.23. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking of the humbled ſoul made capable of faith; <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there be a meſſenger with him, an Interpreter, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thouſand to ſhew unto man his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> the word is <hi>rectitudinem,</hi> or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:119999:147"/>to wit, the righteouſneſs of faith, or which faith apprehends. As though the Miniſtry of the word were the proper means of faith. And ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye, and teach all Nations</hi> (ſaith our Saviour unto his Apoſtles) the word in the Original is, <hi>make Diſciples;</hi> that is, by preaching beget men and women to the faith. And <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature;</hi> (to every reaſonable Creature, Gentiles as well as Jewes) and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what followes, <hi>He that believeth;]</hi> as though the preaching of the word were the only ordinary means for the begetting of faith. And in the ſame manner it followeth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and the ſame purpoſe, <hi>John</hi> 17.20 <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.15, 16. Now we come to the Grounds or Demonſtrations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The firſt Ground is, the unbelief which generally raignes in ſuch places and Congregations where the preaching of the Word is not. Examine thoſe places, and what ſhall we find that favours of faith? what groſs ignorance? what prophaneneſſe, and what worldlineſs may be obſerved in them? men and women living as though they had no ſouls, or as though the ſoul were mortal, and the body immortal; frugallity and worldly providence being the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:119999:147"/>aimed at. The very beſt in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aforeſaid (who content themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preaching of the Word) <hi>ſuppoſing gain to be Godlinſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.5 thinking that he is Religious enough that ſtores up out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things for himſelf and poſterity. This is one Demonſtration to let us ſee, that the preaching of the Word is the only, ordinary, outward means for the begetting of faith; to wit, The general unbelief and fruits of it, which raign in thoſe places where this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The ſecond Ground. The oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in thoſe perſons who have not faith, to the preaching of the word (eſpecially being plain and powerful:) To this purpoſe ſee 2 <hi>The.</hi> 3.2 (as though all unbelievers did oppoſe this Ordinance, and ſo they do in ſome kind or other) Hence it is that ſuch perſons have ſo many exceptions to the Miniſters of God and their families; for ſo ſometimes the perſons aforeſaid reach to the Miniſter by cauſeleſs carping at his Family, or by aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating every weakneſs and infirmity of them in his Family. It may be ſome of them are more modeſt then to ſpeak againſt the Minſter himſelf; but they will labour his derogation, and to derogate from his pains by inveying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe appertaining unto him, his Family,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:119999:148"/>or Aſſociates. Hence it is likewiſe that the perſons aforeſaid do account the beſt kind of preaching, (to wit, plain and powerful) no better then fooliſhneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. that they ſay, it was never good world ſince there was ſo much preaching; ſince ſo much preaching the times are grown hard, good houſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is laid down, and all merriment and jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality is gone out of the world. And hence it is, when they obſerve any forward to hear Sermons, that they ſay, they are mad, or will go mad, that all ſuch are hypocrites and diſſemblers, and of all people in the world, not to be truſted; brand them with the names of Puritans and Preciſians: Now this oppoſition in ſuch as have no faith, to the preaching of the word, is an evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that the preaching of the Word is the proper Ordinance for the begetting of faith: The preaching of the word oppoſeth unbelief, and unbelievers oppoſe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3 The third Ground. The great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that the miniſters of God, of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have made to diſcharge this Duty; as do but ſee <hi>Jerem.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.42. and 6.4. and 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Wo be unto me</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>if I preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.2. And ſo at this day, the more conſcionable Miniſters are, the more they
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:119999:148"/>labour in the Word and Doctrine, the more diligent they are in preaching of the Word; they well knowing, that as this is a good means to perfect faith in thoſe that have it; why ſo, that it is the only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means to beget faith, to make Satan to fall like lightning from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to enlarge the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. The fourth Ground. The high eſteem of the preaching of the Word by all ſuch as have faith (by all that are kindly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers) except in times of diſſertion, thereby intimating that it was the only outward means of their faith: And from their high eſteem of this Ordinance it is that they do ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and fervently pray, that the Lord would more and more ſend forth Labourers into his harveſt; that they do ſo plot and project to live under a faithful and conſcion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Miniſtry: that they do ſo honour and reverence painful and conſcionable Miniſters; that they are ſo liberal and bountiful to them, that they do ſo grieve when any of their mouthes are ſtopped; that they are ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenters of Sermons. And hence it is that they do ſo ſtir up their Families, Friends, and Neighbours to partake of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.3. Now this high eſteem that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:119999:149"/>all true Believers have of the preaching of the Word, doth not a little demonſtrate the good they have received by it, to wit, Faith and Converſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. The fifth Ground. The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the bleſſings that have attended the preaching of the Word this way, to wit, for the begetting of faith. As conſider we firſt of particular perſons: 2. Of particular Churches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of particular Perſons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.4. 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>Philem. ver.</hi> 10, 19. Nay, ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate perſons coming in this way, as many of the Prieſts who had a chief hand in crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.7. And ſome of the moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Athenians, who held the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> no better then a <hi>Babler, Acts</hi> 17.18.34.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider we of particular Churches, as <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Epheſ</hi> 1.13. Nay, all the particular perſons and Churches writ unto, their faith and converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is aſcribed to the preaching of the Word, as the only outward means, as might eaſily be manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. The ſixth Ground (which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if there were no other.) The good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and appointment of God: He in his eternal Wiſdom hath ordained the preaching of the Word as the only, ordinary, outward
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:119999:149"/>means for the begetting of faith; as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is a far off, and to him that is near, ſaith the Lord.</hi> By <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> we are to underſtand abundance of peace, which is a fruit of faith: By the <hi>fruit of the lips,</hi> the Miniſtry of the Word. And obſerve the word <hi>Create,</hi> that is, I ordain: the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all is, I ordain and appoint the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Word as the only ordinary means of faith, the mother of true peace. And <hi>James</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.</hi> Why did he beget us to the Faith with the word of truth? Becauſe he would, becauſe he ſo pleaſed. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>So then, Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> How comes the hearing of the Word preached to be the meanes of faith, the only, ordinary, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of Faith? By the Word of God; that is to ſay, by the ordinance and appointment of God. And ſo 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>For after that in the wiſdome of God</hi> (this frame and Government of the world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wiſdom of God ſhineth ſo clearly) <hi>the world by wiſdom</hi> (to wit, by that wiſdom) <hi>knew not God; it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching</hi> (a means which the world holds fooliſh) <hi>to ſave them that believe.</hi> Firſt to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119999:150"/>beget faith in them by this means, and then by faith to ſave them. And to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are the places following, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16, 19, 20. Thus you ſee that the point is very clear and evident that the preaching of the Word is the only, ordinary, outward meanes for the begetting of faith.</p>
                  <p>But before we come to the Application, we intend to anſwer ſome Queſtions and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Two Queſtions. The firſt Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, What Preaching is? 2. What are the ſignes of ſuch Preachers as are the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beget faith in men and women?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What Preaching is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Preaching (in a general and large ſenſe) is to declare, or any wayes make known the will of God unto man. In this ſenſe every declaration of the will of God (be it by way of his Mercies, Judgments, or Creatures) may improperly be called Preaching, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.1. And in this general and large ſenſe, <hi>Reading</hi> alſo may be called <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Preaching in a more ſpecial and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe is a publike action of the Miniſter, whereby he opens and expounds the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and applies them to the uſe of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:119999:150"/>
                     <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.8. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. This is the Preaching which our Saviour intends, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. and which the ſame Apoſtle implies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. as is plain, compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 14 of the ſame Chapter: and ſo that kind of preaching which the Catechiſm ſpeaks of, This kind of preaching being the only, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, outward means for the begetting of faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2 What are the ſignes of ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Preachers, as are the moſt likely to beget faith in men and women?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. When Miniſters are laborious and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious (hence it is that the Miniſters of God in Scripture are called <hi>Stewards, Huſbandmen, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, Criers)</hi> when in their private ſtudies they give <hi>attendance to reading,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13. when they are oft in the Pulpit, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. and there zealous, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.1. Such Preachers (as it were) compel men and women to come in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When Miniſters are much given to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. Do but obſerve how fruitful the pains of ſuch are.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When Miniſters preach diſtinctly and plainly <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 When they are of holy lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.24.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 When they are much, but unjuſtly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119999:151"/>and perſecuted by Satan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (ſo were all the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) this doth not a little enlarge them in their paines. Let but the people of God obſerve the fruit of a perſecuted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Laſtly, When Miniſters already and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have been inſtruments to beget faith, the bleſſing of God hath formerly attended their paines this way; as the Apoſtle could tell the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. and 9.2. Thoſe that have begot to the faith, are likely ſtill to be inſtruments in that kind. Now we come to anſwer ſome Objections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. What will you ſay then of our Anceſtors and forefathers (that did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Preaching) what, did they all die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, and ſo conſequently, are they all damned?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This were a very harſh and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cenſure: And yet firſt, it muſt needs be granted, that we in theſe times are much bound to God for the plentiful fruition of the Ordinary means, to wit, the preaching of the word. 2 That the caſe of the multitude in the times aforeſaid was very fearful and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to theſe places of Scripture. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18. and <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30 <hi>The times of this ignorance God winked at,</hi> or regarded not; that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:119999:151"/>is, cared not what became of them that lived in thoſe times: This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of thoſe Gentiles that lived in thoſe times when the ordinarie means was not enjoyed. And <hi>Acts</hi> 18.10. As though where the Lord hath much people, many of his Elect; he doth uſe to ſend the Miniſtry of the word.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the premiſes, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that the Lord had ſome of his Elect in all ages; and no queſtion, did worke faith in every one of them, either by other means (when they did not enjoy the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means) or elſe immediately. For in extraordinary times (when the ordinary means can neither be had for coſt nor labour) the Lord works extraordinarily, in ſo many as belong to election. As at this day he works in Elect infants (that are taken away by death before they come to years) and ſo in naturall fools, diſtracted people, and ſuch as are born deaf, belonging to election.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2 But may ſome man ſay, me thinks the reading of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>criptures ſhould be as good a means for the begetting of faith, as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, I am ſo far from ſpeaking a word againſt the reading of the Scriptures, as I could earneſtly deſire that men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:119999:152"/>were more frequent and conſtant in that exerciſe; that in private (as a part of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſecret devotions) they would more diligently exerciſe themſelves in the reading of the Scriptures. And further, that they would make more conſcience of attending unto the Scriptures read in publick, and not do as ſome, who caſt not to come to the Church or Chappel untill the Miniſter be ready to go into the pulpit: The reading of the Scriptures privately, and the attending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them read publickly, doth not a little prepare and further people to profit by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I anſwer, You do ill to compare reading with preaching; preaching being a more likely means of knowledg, and the encreaſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very grace, then reading. A man comes into a Wardrope where many rich garments are folded up together in a narrow roome; this is ſomething: But theſe garments being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded and laid forth to his veiw particularly; this is a great deal more for his information and ſatisfaction: what is a heap of corne, to corn threſhed out, and ground? a loaf of bread in the lump, to a loaf divided and cut in pieces?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt give that ordinance leave to be the ordinary means for the begetting of faith,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:119999:152"/>which the Lord in his wiſedome hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. It is Gods wiſdome, not ours, that muſt appoint the ordinary means of faith.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the Application.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For <hi>reprehenſion:</hi> Firſt, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove divers in the Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as take upon them paſtorall charge and have no skill, no ability to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the word, to expound and apply the Scriptures to their congregations: thoſe are they whom the ſpirit of God cals <hi>dumb dogs, Iſaiah</hi> 56 10. It is true indeed, many men and women praiſe and like well of ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ſay they are honeſt, quiet, and peaceable men, and would have all well with little adoe. But the truth is, they are but criers without voices, meſſengers without legs, and nurſes without milke; and to ſpeak plainly, no better then ſoul murderers. And were but the eies of their people opened, they would be ſo far from praiſing and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Miniſters, as they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them an heavy and intolerable curſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To reprove ſuch Miniſters as have miniſterial gifts, can preach, and yet ſeldome do. The former we may <hi>cal idol Miniſters,</hi> and theſe <hi>idle Miniſters:</hi> Do ſuch
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:119999:153"/>Miniſters take the beſt, and likelieſt courſe to beget faith in their hearers? do they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the Apoſtles? <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4. Do they in this ſlothfull way of theirs behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Gods ſeedſmen? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.6. as Gods husbandmen? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. The husbandmans work (we know) is never at an end; Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter; what vacation to him in any of theſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To reprove ſuch Miniſters as preach, and that frequently; but not to the capacities of their hearers, and ſo as in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they may profit; with their quaint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, their mixture of languages, and their confuſed method, they only tickle the ears of their people, but are never likely to come near their hearts. The <hi>day of Penticoſt,</hi> when <hi>cloven tongues reſted upon the Apoſtles, Acts</hi> 2.6. <hi>They ſpeak to every man in his own langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi> And ſo <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1, 4. And <hi>Acts</hi> 14.1. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had a regard to the manner of their preaching; and ſee the effect of it; a plain methodicall, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull preaching is the liklieſt to beget faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To reprove ſuch Miniſters as preach, and preach frequently, and plainly; but their lives are blemiſhed with ſome ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:119999:153"/>ſin or other they live in the practiſe of, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56.11, 12 I do not deny, but ſuch Miniſters may be Inſtruments to beget faith; yet</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are not in all points ſo qualified, as is fit the Miniſters of God ſhould be: <hi>Titus</hi> 1.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They cannot upon good grounds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a bleſſing upon their pains, as holy Miniſters may; <hi>Acts</hi> 11.24. The bad life of a Preacher, doth not a little diſgrace Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hinder the powerful effect of it in the hearts of his Hearers; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21, 22, 24. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p>As this Uſe of Reproof doth extend it ſelf to Miniſters, ſo likewiſe to the people, or Hearers; divers of them being very careleſs of this Ordinance, (the plain and powerful Preaching of the word;) and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of faith: as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as live in places where this great bleſſing is, and yet do not value it, highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of it; and this they manifeſt divers wayes: 1. Being ſo ready to <hi>ſpeak evil</hi> of their painful Watch-men or at the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <hi>entertain evil reports</hi> of them, contrary to that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. 2. So unwilling to impart to their <hi>outward maintenance,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that, <hi>Galatiuns</hi> 6.6. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:119999:154"/>See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.24. 3. By partaking of their pains ſo ſeldome: It may be ſometimes they will hear a Sermon (when they have little elſe to do,) but do not hear conſtantly; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. Preaching and hearing are Relatives, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt not Preach to the walls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To reprove ſuch people, as live in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where Preaching is not, and yet do not caſt to remove to ſuch places, as where it may be enjoyed; and in the mean time, do not take pains upon the Sabbath and other dayes, to partake of this Ordinance where it may be had. Surely ſuch people little weigh the Doctrine in hand, neither the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture following, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To reprove ſuch people, as being to remove from one place to another, to ſettle their abode never enquire after this <hi>one thing neceſſary;</hi> or if they be to ſend their Chidren abroad, to live in this ſervice or that, never think of it, what Miniſter they ſhall live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether a dumb Dog, or a Preaching Miniſter. It may be, (nay no queſtion) if themſelves be to remove, they will enquire of the Ayre, Water, and other outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and conveniences. And ſo for their Children, whether they ſhall be ſure to have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119999:154"/>their wages paid them, to have meat and drink enough: but for them or theirs, living under a conſcionable and painful Miniſtry, is no part of their care.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Eſpecially to reprove the prophaneneſs of ſuch as cry out, that it was never good world ſince there was ſo much Preaching, ſo many Preachers. That ſay, (or at the leaſt think) of all Callings and conditions of men, Preachers might be beſt ſpared. But how contrary theſe men are to God, do but ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30.20. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.12. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.9, 10. Thus much now for this Uſe of Reprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For <hi>Information.</hi> 1. To let us ſee how great cauſe we have to pity ſuch as do not enjoy the Preaching of the word; ſuch poor ſouls <hi>ſitting in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death:</hi> and ſo, little likelyhood of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the grace of faith; the Preaching of the Word being the onely ordinary means that way, as we hear in the Doctrine. And the more to be pityed ſuch perſons be, becauſe they do ſo little pity themſelves; for who ſo little ſenſible of the want of Preaching, as they that have it not? Well, although they do not pity themſelves, yet let us (who know them to be the objects of pity) in pity to their poor ſouls, pray (and that earneſtly)
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:119999:155"/>for their ſupply this way, according to our Saviours example and command, <hi>Matthew</hi> 9.36. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To let us ſee into the hopeful condition of ſuch as do enjoy this Ordinance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly depend upon the ſame. If our friends, kindred live in ſuch places, where plain and powerful Preaching is, and they uſually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſame; (although for the preſent we conceive them in the eſtate of nature, and their way and courſe but carnal) why yet they are people of hope, and there is ſome probability of their converſions in due time. The principal end why the Lord doth ſend forth, and imploy his Miniſters, is to gather his Elect. And their ſending to places, doth argue the Lord to have of his Elect there. And why may not thy kindred and friends be of that number?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Paſtors,</hi> that they would Preach, preach, preach; that they would be diligent in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Preaching, ſeeing it is the onely ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means for the gaining of ſouls, and for the winning of their people to God; and ſo they ſhall manifeſt, not onely a great love and affection to their people, and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but likewiſe to themſelves: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:119999:155"/>
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. Nay even to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 21.15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To exhort the <hi>People,</hi> that they would not appoint God by what means to beſtow faith upon them, but would ſubmit to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and Ordinance. Then may a man aſſure himſelf of a bleſſing, when he ſeeketh it in the Ordinance of God, in that way which God hath chalked out and appointed for that end and purpoſe. Why doth bread nouriſh us, rather then the graſs of the field? It is Gods Ordinance. And if the Lord will have faith to enter by the ear, as at the firſt ſin did; let us not ſtand reaſoning with him, but ſubmit to his Ordinance. Oh therefore all men and women, that think they have ſouls, (and deſire the good of them) let them make out to this Ordinance upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, upon the Week-day; borrow ſome time of the particular calling; hear in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; ſuffer not the body to ſterve the ſoul, the particular calling to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs all your time from the general. Nay, call upon your families, friends, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours this way, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 2.3. As <hi>Philip</hi> called <hi>Nathaniel, Iohn</hi> 1.45. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> fetch'd her Neighbours to come to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4.29. So let us excite and ſtir up one another to this Ordinance. And
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:119999:156"/>thus farre touching the firſt part of the firſt Member; <hi>faith cometh onely by the Preaching of the word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the next place, the Catechiſme ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us with the principal outward means whereby faith is increaſed. 1. By <hi>the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word,</hi> or <hi>the hearing of the word Preached.</hi> 2. By <hi>the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi> 3. By <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt outward means the Catechiſme mentions for faiths encreaſe, is <hi>the preaching of the word,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>And encreaſeth daily by it:</hi> And from this paſſage we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this point of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>As the preaching of the word is the onely ordinary outward means for the begetting of faith, why ſo it is a very good means for the daily increaſe of faith.</hi> More briefly. <hi>The preaching of the word, or the hearing of the word preached, is a very good means for the daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Ordinance is like to a kind, natural Mother, which giveth ſuck to the Child which ſhe hath brought forth; it being, not onely the <hi>ſeed</hi> of faith, but likewiſe the daily <hi>food</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine in hand is very evident, if ſo be we look into the Scriptures: as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Romans</hi> 1.11. 1 <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 3.10.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119999:156"/>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 14.21, 22. and 20.32. And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p>If we would have the point further argued,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take we notice of the promiſe of God unto true Believers, conſtantly, and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably depending on this Ordinance; <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the great hunger and thirſt that is in true Believers unto this Ordinance, <hi>Job</hi> 23.12. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.4. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſult we with experience. Such Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as take all lawful occaſions, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting opportunities to partake of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, do they not come on in faith, and the other graces of Gods Spirit? <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.8. But ſuch of them as are more careleſs of this Ordinance, ſuffer ſloth, and every trivial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to hinder them from it, (at the leaſt on the week day;) is not their faith lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and languiſhing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But may ſome man ſay, Do you think that Sermons on the week day are to be attended and waited on?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, no queſtion, by all men and women that can poſſibly find time and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from their particular callings, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.42. (in the ſpace betwixt that and the Sabbath, as it is in the Original.) And <hi>Luke</hi> 19.47, 48. And when they cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119999:157"/>of this Ordinance (on the week day) without the overthrow of their particular callings; yet ſurely then they ought to deſire after it, and to account them happy, that may take that liberty themſelves may not: as <hi>David</hi> (when he was hindred from Gods Publick Worſhip) doth expreſs himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.1, 2, 3, 4. Now we come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To reprove ſome that profeſs themſelves to have faith, but are too careleſs of partaking frequently of this Ordinance; any little ſickneſs, pain or cold keeping them from the Publick Aſſembly upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; and the leaſt worldly occaſion hindring them from it on the week day. Such perſons do not imitate <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 27.4. nor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Luke</hi> 10.39. but <hi>Martha.</hi> Such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are not like to come on in faith, have little comfort of their faith, do not by their profeſſion much beautifie the Goſpel. And ſurely this neglect is one main cauſe, why many old Profeſſors, are but mean Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in knowledge, faith, and holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and why they are ſo outſtriped by young Profeſſors, that are more diligent in the uſe of this means: as <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. and 18.15. Theſe perſons may think themſelves wiſer then thoſe that are more forward; but when their faith comes to be ſoundly tryed, by any
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:119999:157"/>great affliction, they will (by woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) find the contrary: Fiery tryals are to be expected, and looked for of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and then a great ſtock of faith will not ſtand a man in little ſtead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. To incite and ſtir up all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers conſtantly to depend on this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and if their particular callings be ſuch, as will not ſuffer them often (on the week day) to partake of it, why yet let them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in affection; earneſtly deſire after this <hi>Manna,</hi> and bleſs God for the liberty that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have in this kind. It is true indeed, thoſe that are ſo forward this way, ſhall be called Preciſians, fools, and mad people, by the worldly wiſe; and that they will gad to Sermons, until they have made all away, and brought themſelves to beggery; but <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her Children:</hi> and if the like aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions (in the ſame caſe) were caſt upon the Head, well may the Members be contented; <hi>Mark</hi> 3.21. And for beggery which they object, let the true Believer rather hearken to Gods Spirit, then to thoſe Carpers and Cavillers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may profit, more and more profit by partaking of this Ordinance, I will lay down ſome directions. 1. Some things
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:119999:158"/>muſt be done before we come to hear. 2. Some things in the act of hearing. 3. Some things after we have heard.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some things muſt be done before we come to hear, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt come in hatred of all ſin. That this muſt be laboured and endeavoured, ſee <hi>Exek.</hi> 14 1. unto the ninth verſe. And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt come with our hearts as empty of all worldly cares and thoughts, as poſſibly we can attain unto: <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he went to ſacrifice his ſon in the Mount, left his Aſs and his ſervants a good ſpace behind him; <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.5. So muſt we put away, and abandon our worldly thoughts and cares, when we come to hear the word; labour all we can to come with empty and free hearts this way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt come with humble hearts, and hungry appetites to this Ordinance, (being ſenſible of our great need of it, that we may be further builded up) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.53. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt come with a readineſs and willingneſs, to hear and learn every truth the Miniſtry of the word ſhall commend unto us, (as well one truth as another, ſuppoſe never ſo croſs to our humours) <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:119999:158"/>And ſo Miniſters are injoyned to teach, (as they have time and opportunity) <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt come with a purpoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to obey and practiſe, ſo far as the Lord in his word ſhall reveal himſelf unto us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.33, 34. <hi>John</hi> 7.17.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We muſt come in faith and confidence of a bleſſing upon our hearing, according as God hath promiſed, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.3. and 57.19. Do we not know what the Lord hath ſaid of his word, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. <hi>James</hi> 1.21, Believe we this, and expect we the truth of it in our hearing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Before we come, be we earneſt with the Lord by prayer, for a bleſſing upon our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We muſt be earneſt in prayer for our Teachers. 1. That <hi>their lips may preſerve knowledge.</hi> 2. That they may be faithful, in delivering <hi>the whole Councel of God</hi> unto us. 3. That they may ſpeak <hi>powerfully to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;</hi> all which we have comprized, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.3.4. And then for ourſelves, that we may hear to edification, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 48.17. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.18. If we muſt pray before the receiving of our bodily food, much more before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the food of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In coming to hear the word, we muſt caſt to come timely, and not ſo foreſlow the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119999:159"/>time, as but to come to a piece of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8.1. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. and <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. Theſe things we have ſpoken of, muſt be done before our hearing of the word, in way of Preparation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In our hearing of the word, ſome things muſt be laboured and endeavoured: As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You muſt ſet your ſelves as in Gods preſence, while you are hearing of his word, (and this will be a good means to prevent ſleeping, talking, reading gazing about, and all other unreverent behaviour.) See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.11. Eſpecially whiles we are ſerving him in the duties of his immediate worſhip. Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In hearing of the word, we muſt attend diligently to what we hear; not ſuffering any part of that which is delivered to overſlip as, <hi>Revelations</hi> 2.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.44. and <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In hearing of the word, we muſt labour to hear with underſtanding and judgement, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In hearing of the word, we muſt labour to hear with affection and delight, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.37. This kind of hearing will not a little help our memories, nor a little
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:119999:159"/>encourage our Teachers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.16. That this kind of hearing doth greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Teacher, is evident by common experience.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In hearing of the word, we muſt apply to our ſelves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.22. This is that which the Lord calls upon us for, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.2 <hi>Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good.</hi> The beſt food can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not nouriſh us, unleſs we take it, and eat it; neither the word, if we do not apply it. Theſe things to be done in hearing of the word, if ſo be we would profit by it.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the things that muſt be done after the receiving of the word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ſhall find this no little help unto us, to confer one with another of the word we have heard, as ſoon as we depart the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſembly; Gods people to repeat the Sermon one to another, and to confer of it (as they go home together) one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.272. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37.30, 31. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If ſo be we would profit by the word, we muſt meditate, and ſeriouſly think of that we have heard: All the things the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> heard of Chriſt, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 2.19, 51. So the good man is deſcribed, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1.2. And <hi>David</hi> himſelf, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.15, 97. This is an
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:119999:160"/>excellent means to make the word our own and to grow by it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such as are Domeſtick Governors, (if ſo be they would have thoſe under them to profit by the word) after the Publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe (before they go to Family-Prayer in the evening) let them examine their Family, touching what they have heard that day in Publick, confer with them of the word they have heard, repeat it unto them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. Thus our Saviour with his Family, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.51. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.34.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be we earneſt with the Lord in Family, and ſecret Prayer, to write his word in our hearts, and to give us a kindly digeſtion of it; it being Prayer, both before hearing, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that muſt ſanctifie this Spiritual food un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. And in Prayer, remember we to be earneſt for the good (every way) of thoſe faithful Inſtruments, of whoſe pains we have partaked; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fift thing after hearing, (if we doubt of any thing we have heard) Let us in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent and humble manner, repair to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for ſatisfaction and reſolution; <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.38. and 19.10. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.17.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sixtly and laſtly, Let us preſently ſet upon the practiſe of that we have heard, (this being the end of all our hearing)
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:119999:160"/>
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.60. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.1. <hi>James</hi> 1.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus we have done with the firſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the fifth Principle.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="member">

                  <p>NOw we come to the ſecond Member of the fift Principle, which acquaints us with another good means whereby faith is encreaſed; to wit, the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, in theſe words: <hi>As alſo by the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we come to ſpeak of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments particularly, we intend (by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction) ſome queſtions of Sacraments in general: As 1. In what they agree with the word, and in what they differ from it. 2. What Sacraments are. 3. What are the ends of Sacraments. 4. What are the parts of a Sacrament. 5. The union of the parts, or Sacramental union, what it is. 6. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agree, and how they differ. 7. The number of Sacraments now in the time of the New Teſtament. Theſe queſtions being plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:119999:161"/>anſwered, we ſhall the better underſtand the Doctrine of Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. How Sacraments agree with the word, and how they differ from it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They agree in their Author, the Lord being, as the Author of the word, ſo likewiſe of all true Sacraments, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.3, .11. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The word and Sacraments agree in this, that the one as well as the other, is to be diſpenſed by lawful Miniſters, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that they both offer and reach forth one and the ſame thing; to wit, Chriſt. Thus we ſee in what the word and Sacraments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</p>
                  <p>Now they differ as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The word declareth Gods Will unto us by ſpeech; the Sacraments by viſible ſignes and geſtures; Sacraments being a viſible word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The word is as a <hi>Charter,</hi> or Letter-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, promiſing all good things in Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all true Believers. The Sacraments are as <hi>ſeals</hi> annexed to this <hi>Charter,</hi> confirming what the word promiſeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the word, faith is begun and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; by the Sacraments, it is only confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:119999:161"/>
                  <p n="4">4. The word pertaineth to all; the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely to ſuch as make a profeſſion of the faith.</p>

                  <p>The ſign is the Element, or Elements; as Water, Bread, Wine, and the whole exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action converſant about the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The thing ſignified, is Chriſt and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; or the participation and communion of Chriſt and his benefits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. The union of the parts, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental union, what it is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This union is a real union, Chriſt and the Elements are truly and really united.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:119999:162"/>Hence it is, that our Saviour ſaith of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Bread, <hi>this is my body;</hi> and of the Wine, <hi>this is my blood;</hi> Mat. 26.26, 28.</p>
                  <p>But this union is not a <hi>Phyſical or natural union,</hi> (as the Papiſts hold) as though the ſign were changed or altered in o the thing ſignified. Neither is it a <hi>local union</hi> (as the Lutherans dream;) as though the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied were locally preſent, as well as the ſign: but it is a <hi>myſtical and Spiritual union,</hi> and conſiſts in the things following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A natural aptneſs in the ſign, to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and expreſs the thing ſignified. As, doth not water naturally repreſent and expreſs a cleanſing; and bread and wine a nouriſhing and comforting?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lords appointing and applying of ſuch and ſuch Elements unto Sacramental uſe: as Water, to reſemble Chriſt in his waſhing and cleanſing quality; Bread and Wine, to reſemble Chriſt in his nouriſhing and comforting property. This being that, (to wit, the word of Ordinance) that carries the ſoul of the Believer from earth to heaven, from the ſign, unto the thing ſignified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord ordaining and appointing the outward ſign, not onely to repreſent and reſemble Chriſt and his benefits, but likewiſe as an Inſtrument and Channel to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:119999:163"/>convey him and his benefits really to the ſoul of the true Believer; the true Believer at one and the ſame time receiving the ſign and the thing ſignified; the one Corporally, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritually. And thus we ſee the union betwixt the ſign, and thing ſignified is real, but Spiritual; and wherein it conſiſts</p>
                  <p>Now from the union aforeſaid, it is uſual in the Scrptures, (by an improper, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſpeech) 1. To call the ſign by the name of the thing ſignified; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. 2. To aſcribe that to the ſign, which is proper to the thing ſignified; and contrarily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. How the Sacraments of the old and new Teſtament agree? &amp; how they differ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They agree in the <hi>Author,</hi> they all being ordained and inſtituted by God. 2. They agree in the <hi>thing ſignified;</hi> to wit, Chriſt and his benefits: the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of the Old Teſtament, being as well ſaved by Chriſt, as the Believers of the New; <hi>Romans</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. Now they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer divers wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In <hi>clearneſs.</hi> The Covenant of grace was more hidden and obſcure in the time of the Old Teſtament, (Chriſt the Foundation of it being not then come) then in the time of the New; and ſo the ſeals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:119999:163"/>ſutably: the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament pointing at Chriſt to come, but the Sacraments of the New, ſhewing that Chriſt is come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In <hi>efficacy.</hi> The Sacraments of the New Teſtament (in the ordinary courſe) being more effectual then the Sacraments of the Old; a greater power of the Spirit (in the ordinary courſe) going with ours, then did with theirs; our ſouls being more perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and impreſſive then theirs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They differ in <hi>number;</hi> there was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sacraments in the time of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, not onely Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover, (Sacraments ordinary) but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe extraordinary Sacraments; (or as ſome call them, reſemblances) as the Red Sea, the Cloud, Manna, and the water of the Rock. It is: true, there was no more ordinary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the time of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (no more Sacraments for being and ſtanding) then in the time of the New.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7. The laſt queſtion. What's the number of Sacramens in the time of the New Teſtament?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Onely two: <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>the Lords Supper;</hi> the former ſucceeding <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumoiſion,</hi> the latter the <hi>Paſſeover.</hi> And both theſe as durable as the Church; to

Theſe queſtions of Sacraments in general, being anſwered, we ſhall come more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeak of either Sacrament particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

But how is the Covenant kept on our part? Where is our living by faith, our growing in mortification, in ſelf-denial? Where is our courage for Gods truth, our zeal for his glory, our love to his Saints? Try we, try we how far we have broken our Covenant; be we aſhamed of it, bewail we it, and labour we amendment. Alas! the moſt, they reſt in the thing done, in a bare formality, little ſtir up themſelves to make good their promiſe ratified by ſolemn oath; nay, are not earneſt with the Lord to enable them this way.

                  <p>Doct. <hi>The Sacrament of Baptiſm, is a good outward means for the increaſe of faith.</hi> The Point is proved by theſe Scriptures; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. &amp; 10.47. and <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8.</p>

So the Lord is pleaſed to condeſcend to our weakneſs, and our belief; as (for the ſupport and encreaſe of our faith) he doth not onely afford us his Promiſe, but Oath; not onely his Covenant, but Seales.</p>

Taken from the Sacrament that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſucceeds, to wit, <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was a good outward means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and encreaſe faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. and then can Baptiſm be of leſs uſe and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What Baptiſm is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the firſt Sacrament of the Goſpel, whereby we are waſhed with water, in the Name of the Father the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; to ſignifie and ſeal our ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Chriſt, our communion with Chriſt, our new obedience, and admiſſion into the viſible Church. Somewhat to open this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ſay, <hi>It is the firſt Sacrament of the Goſpel;</hi> becauſe it is to precede the Lords Supper. The ſons and daughters of men, are firſt to be baptized, before they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, or ſhould be admitted to the Lords Supper: that is, no unbaptized perſon ſhould adventure, or ought to be admitted to the Lords Table.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſay, <hi>Whereby we are waſhed with water;</hi> for ſo the word Baptiſm ſignifies, a dipping in water, or ſprinkling with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſay, <hi>In the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> this being the very form of Baptiſm that muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And for the meaning of theſe words, <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:119999:166"/>Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> it is as much as to ſay, as that the Party baptized, is conſecrated to the worſhip and ſervice of the Trinity.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. To ſignifie and ſeal our <hi>communion with Chriſt:</hi> That is to ſay, to ſignifie and ſeal that we are made partakers of Chriſt and his benefits, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There be divers ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this and that Party might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Members of the viſible Church, <hi>John</hi> 4.1. as though Baptiſm were an outward mark of a Diſciple, and a means of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting into the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it might be a pledge unto
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:119999:166"/>us of our <hi>ingrafting</hi> into Chriſt, the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes,</hi> and <hi>Regeneration; Galatians</hi> 3.27. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 3.5.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are either outward, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The outward is the ſign, and the word. The ſign is the element of Water, and the Sacramental action on the Miniſters part, and on the Receivers part; the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall action on the Miniſters part, is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his waſhing of the Party with water, but
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:119999:167"/>likewiſe his putting the Party into the water, or towards the water; his continuing the Party in the water, or towards the water; and his taking the Party out of the water, or from towards the water. The Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal action on the Receivers part, is:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The preſenting of him or her unto the Miniſter to be baptized.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The receiving of external waſhing by water.</p>
                  <p>The other outward thing is the word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The word of <hi>inſtitution,</hi> or the Miniſters Commiſſion in this kind, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The word of promiſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The diſtinct pronouncing of this form: <hi>I baptize thee in,</hi> or <hi>into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The inward thing, or thing ſignified, is Juſtification and Sanctification. The water repreſents, and ſhadoweth forth the blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. The Miniſters waſhing of the Party with water, ſignifies and ſeals the double waſhing aforeſaid; to wit of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and Sanctification; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 11. The Miniſters putting the Party into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or towards the water, ſignifies and ſeals the Mortification of ſinne in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Miniſters continuing the Party
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:119999:167"/>in the water, or towards the water, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and ſeals the burial of ſinne, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual encreaſe of Mortification in the Party; and his taking the Party out of the water, or from towards the water, the Partyes Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification, or raiſing up to newneſs of life; <hi>Romans</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. The Partyes preſenting to Baptiſm, and his receiving of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal waſhing, ſignifies and ſeals, how he conſecrates himſelf to God and how he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly renounceth the fleſh, the world, and Divel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Baptiſm is not ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, ſo as there is no ſalvation without it; for this were to make it equal with Chriſts blood, and to ſend all to the pit of Hell that die unbaptized; although the fault be no way in themſelves, or Parents.

                  <p n="1">1 In regard of Gods Ordinance, the Lord having commanded it to be uſed, it is neceſſary it ſhould be uſed in obedience to his command.

The bread and wine not only repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the body and blood of Chriſt, but exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting and conveying them to the ſoul of the beleever for his ſpirituall nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. How the Lords Supper differs from baptiſm?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, We will ſhew briefly wherein they agree: Secondly, wherin they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                  <p>They <hi>agree</hi> in theſe things. Firſt, they both <hi>repreſent</hi> whole Chriſt to the ſoul. Secondly they both ſeal up whole Chriſt to the ſoul (we mean by whole Chriſt, as Chriſt for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſo for ſanctification.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Now theſe Sacraments <hi>differ</hi> divers waies. Firſt, in <hi>order,</hi> baptiſm goes before, and the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:119999:175"/>ſupper follows; as being, goes before grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Secondly, In <hi>frequency;</hi> Baptiſm is but once to be received, the Supper often. We are but once born; but after we are borne, we have need of frequent nouriſhment. Thirdly, they differ in the <hi>elements and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rites.</hi> Fourthly in their particular ends; Baptiſm being properly the ſeal of <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but the Supper properly the ſeal of <hi>growth,</hi> and confirmation. The former, the ſeal of Chriſtian being; the latter, the ſeal of Chriſtian well being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. What are the parts of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are either outward, or inward: The outward, as the <hi>ſigne,</hi> and the <hi>word.</hi> By the <hi>ſigne</hi> we mean the elements of bread and wine, and the ſacramentall action on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters part, and on the receivers part. The The other outward thing is, the <hi>word</hi> (the word added to the element, or elements, makes a Sacrament.) Now by the word here we are to underſtand, Firſt the word of <hi>inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or command; <hi>do this</hi> Secondly, the word of <hi>promiſe; this is my body which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for you; this is my blood, which is ſhe d for you.</hi> The inward thing, or thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is the <hi>body aad bloud of Chriſt</hi> given and ſhed for our ſins; and our ſpiritual <hi>eating</hi> and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:119999:176"/>
                     <hi>drinking</hi> of them for our nouriſhment unto eternal life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4 What is to be done of us, that in the uſe of this ordinance our faith may be encreaſed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Something we muſt do <hi>before</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; ſomething <hi>in</hi> and <hi>about the act</hi> of receiving. And ſomething <hi>after</hi> we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt part of the anſwer; what we muſt do <hi>before</hi> our receiving. This the Apoſtle acquaints us with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</hi> Now we are to know, that when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>let a man examine himſelf,</hi> he doth not leave it to our choice and diſcretion; as let a man examine himſelf, if he ſo pleaſe. But the Apoſtle ſpeaks imperatively; that is, I injoyn and command from the Lord every one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receive, to practice this duty of ſelf-examination; that they ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all other occaſions, and in their thoughts make choice of fit time and place, and ſo ſeriouſly fall upon this buſineſſe. And if it be demanded, what we muſt examine our ſelves of or about. I anſwer, firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have ſome meaſure of ſaving <hi>faith</hi> or no. For firſt if we have no meaſure of this
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119999:176"/>grace, how can we expect an encreaſe of it by the Sacrament; an encreaſe of that we are not at all poſſeſſed of? 2. If we have no meaſure of this grace, what have we to do at the Supper of the Lord? it being an ordinance to confirm and ſtrengthen faith where it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begun, and not to begin it where it is not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If upon ſerious examination we find no meaſure of this grace begun in us, hereby we ſhall (or at leaſt ſhould) be occaſioned more earneſtly and conſtantly to depend upon the miniſtry of the word, that this grace may be wrought in us, and ſo in time, we fitted to approach to the Lords Table. And 4. If up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination it appear we have ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this grace; hereby we ſhall not only be encouraged to preſent our ſelves at the Lords Table; but hereby likewiſe, not only this grace of faith, but all other graces (fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a worthy communiacant) wil be pointed, quickned, and ſtirred up in us; that ſo we may more profitably and comfortably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And this is one main reaſon why this duty of ſelf-examination muſt be renewed as oft as we partake at the Lords Table, it being an excellent means to quicken and ſet on work the graces of Gods ſpirit, that ſo we may receive more worthily. Now in affirming, a man muſt examine himſelf before he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:119999:177"/>at the Lords Table; it is not our purpoſe to juſtle out ſelf-examination at other times; as though a man were never to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but then: For he that doth not practiſe a weekly, nay, daily examination, it is to be feared, will be far to ſeek in this Duty, when he ſhould by it prepare himſelf to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Although we make ſome difference betwixt the weekly or daily examination, and the examination before the Sacramen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, the former being but a reviewing and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our daily diſobedience and unkind dealing with the Lord, every way ſo kind and gracious unto us, the better to prepare and fit to ſecret prayer: But the latter being a tryal of our ſelves, how we are qualified as fitting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.</p>
                  <p>Now to lay down ſome Marks and Signes of a true ſaving faith; 1 Do we obſerve our ſelves very ſhort in this Grace; and is it a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and grief unto us? <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. Many ſpeak of a good faith they have had ever ſince they were born, and thank God they have alwayes been freed from doubting; but ſuch perſons are farre from a true ſaving faith. But if upon a true ſight and ſenſe of our miſery wee would faine apply Chriſt, and the promiſe of pardon and forgiveneſs in and through him, grieve becauſe we
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:119999:177"/>can come no nearer Chriſt, and can get him no nearer unto us. This is a good ſigne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What means do we uſe that we may grow in faith? Do we <hi>pray</hi> earneſtly for an encreaſe of it? <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5. many ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never employ themſelves this way, ſeldome or never pray for faith; an ill ſigne, whatſoever they think of themſelves. 2. Do we earneſtly hunger and thirſt after the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word, that ſo we may <hi>grow</hi> in this grace? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2 Divers regard not this ordinance, are very indifferent whether they partake of it or no: This is a very bad ſigne. 3. Do we love a Saint, as a Saint; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a poor man or woman that we perſwade our ſelves to be truly religious and godly, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the richeſt man or woman irreligious or ungodly? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 3. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons, of all people, they cannot away with the forward in religion, have not a good word for them; a very ill ſigne, 4. Is there in us an earneſt endeavour after univerſal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? although we daily take up our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſhort, yet we do not favour our ſelves in this known ſin or that, but mourn for it, ſtrive againſt it (although the corruption inward and unknown to others) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. and 119.101. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. But if our courſe be uneven; we obey in ſome things, but
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:119999:178"/>have no care to obey in other things, in all things; it is an ill ſigne; <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. And ſuch is the obedience of the moſt.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt thing we muſt examine our ſelves of and about, to wit, whether we have <hi>ſaving faith</hi> or no: which if we have not ſome meaſure of we have nothing to do at the Lords Table; but if we come, come upon our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill; and to the great indangering of our ſelves. And yet ſuch perſons muſt not ſit downe ſatisfied without the Sacrament, but muſt earneſtly (in the uſe of all other means) labour for faith, that ſo at the length they may warrantably and comfortably partake of this ordinance. This I ſay, is the firſt thing we muſt examine our ſelves of and about, before our receiving, Whether we have ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſaving faith or no.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing, we muſt examine our ſelves of and about, before we partake at the Lords Table (if ſo be we be ſuch as have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and heretofore worthily received) is how we have profited in faith and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſince the laſt time we received. The Lords Table is a feaſt of growth, and the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects at our hands that the oftner we come to his Table, the more we ſhould come on in grace. Now if upon examination we find our ſelves to grow, we may come with the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:119999:178"/>more boldneſſe and courage, that ſo we may ſtill make a further progreſſe (our experience of receiving good at this feaſt, putting us on.) But if ſo be upon examination, we find our ſelves to have been bad proficients, have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered grace to go out of exerciſe, this or that corruption to get head, we muſt be the more humbled and dejected. And the greater our ſlips and falls have been, the more to make our hearts ſoft and tender by courſes of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; the more earneſt we muſt be with the Lord for pardon and forgiveneſſe, and that he would bleſſe our approaching unto, and proceeding at his table, that ſo we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our ſpirituall ſtrength, and come on in the courſe of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>And one thing we would adde, even to thoſe that carry themſelves the moſt holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and watchfully betwixt Sacraments; that ſeeing they gather and contract ſo much rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh and ſoil in the intermiſſion, as they ſtand in great need to quicken and ſtir up their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to the Sacrament, and all other graces fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting worthy communicants; that theſe, I ſay, would by <hi>extraordinary praier</hi> (before they come to the Sacrament) quicken, and ſtir up the graces of Gods Spirit in themſelves, that ſo they may receive the more worthily. And thus much now touching what we muſt
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:119999:179"/>do <hi>before</hi> we receive, if ſo be we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to the encreaſe of our faith.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is, what we muſt do <hi>in and about the act of receiving,</hi> if ſo be we would receive worthily; and to the encreaſe of our faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such as have prepared themſelves, as aforeſaid; Firſt, muſt labour to make ſure to partake of <hi>all</hi> the publick ordinances before the adminiſtration of the Sacrament. they muſt not come dropping in when the Miniſter is at praier, or in his Sermon; but ſhould take <hi>all</hi> the ordinances before them. 2. Betwixt the Miniſters going out of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit and his repairing to the Lords Table; ſtir up thy ſelf by conſidering that now thou art upon a great buſineſſe, to renew thy covenant with the Lord, and the Lord with thee; he to continue thy gracious, faithfull and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient God in and through Chriſt, for thy good every way. And thou to continue his ſervant in better obedience then ever hitherto thou haſt performed unto him: and as the Lord intends fairly and faithfully towards thee; ſo earneſtly deſire and reſolve the like towards him. 3. When the Miniſter doth addreſſe himſelf to the Celebration; then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſummon thy outward ſenſes and inward affections to attend the whole buſineſſe in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119999:179"/>hand. Let nothing done at this ſacred feaſt fall to the ground, but employ thy outward ſenſes upon the elements, and upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall acts of Miniſter and people; and conſider with thy ſelf (for the inciting and ſtirring up of thy faith) that they are all ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying and ſealing, as before thou haſt heard: and ſo, whilſt thou art thus employed, thou ſhalt not only receive the bread and wine <hi>of the Lord,</hi> but the bread and wine <hi>which is the Lord;</hi> as the one outwardly, ſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inwardly. Thus we have heard what muſt be done <hi>in and about the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we come to the third thing, what muſt be done <hi>after</hi> we have received.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We muſt be willing to joyn with the congregation in <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> and ſo like wiſe in our <hi>liberality</hi> to the poor. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After we are departed the congregation, we muſt labour to keep up our faith, verily perſwading our ſelves that the Lord will not fail a jot of his covenant renewed with us; but as he hath ſaid, and ſealed, ſo he will work in us and for us. It is Satans manner with ſome good communicants, preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have received, to ſtir up in them
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:119999:180"/>thoughts of unbelief; as though their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating were to no purpoſe, but had been altogether in vain. But in this caſe, let them remember that the fleſh of Chriſt is <hi>meat indeed,</hi> and his blood <hi>drink indeed;</hi> and that the Lord in the Sacrament doth not mock the prepared ſoul, but intends fairly and in faithfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometime that day, in ſecret, take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey and review of thy receiving; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward converſe there was betwixt thee and the Lord in that buſineſſe, what ſecret ſignes and paſſages of love; how thy affections were ſtirred and moved, and how they continue. Now in this ſurvey and review, if thou find there hath been little ſtirring and moving, but rather deadneſſe and dulneſſe: then thou haſt juſt cauſe to ſuſpect that there was ſome great want in thy preparation, which if (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination) thou perceiveſt, thou muſt greatly humble and <hi>judg thy ſelf, that ſo thou mayeſt not be judged of the Lord.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. But if upon examination thou find that thou ſeriouſly endeavoredſt to prepare thy ſelf, as did befit this ſacred buſineſſe; although thou muſt be ſenſible of the affliction, yet thou muſt not be too much diſmaied, but in the Lords means, wait the Lords time for the fruit of the Sacrament; remembring what the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:119999:180"/>holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſſe for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart.</hi> Now on the contrary, if in this ſurvey and review thou doſt find thou didſt ſpeed <hi>well</hi> at the Sacrament, that thou hadſt ſweet converſe with the Lord, thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions graciouſly ſtirred and moved, and ſo continue: Oh, then thou haſt great cauſe, 1. To bleſſe and praiſe God. 2. From this experience of his love to be confidently ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with him, that thou maieſt daily find and feel the fruit of the Sacrament. And 3. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, haſt thou not cauſe to be forward to this feaſt another time; nay at all times as thou ſeeſt a call? And 4. and laſtly, haſt thou not cauſe the more carefully to look to the covenant on thy part; as thou haſt vowed, ſo to pay; as thou haſt promiſed new obedience, better obedience, ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the performance? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. and 116.14, 18. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.4, 5. And thus now we have anſwered the fourth queſtion; what muſt be done of us, that in the uſe of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament our faith may be encreaſed. We come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1 To inform us touching the great wrong the Popiſh teachers labour to do the people of God, as concerning this ordinance, by their altering, adding, detracting, anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:119999:181"/>1. By their <hi>altering,</hi> they chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of this ordinance, turning this Sacrament into a propitiatory ſacrifice for the ſins of the living and the dead; the Miniſter into a ſacrificing Prieſt, and the communion Table into an Altar. 2. By <hi>adding</hi> a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and world of ceremonies to this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, of their own inventing, and which have no footſteps in the word of God; they ſo contrarying this buſineſſe, as though they were in hand with ſome masking ſhew, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſome ſtage play. 3.

Thus, and many other waies, do the popiſh teachers go about to wrong Gods people in regard of this excellent ordinance, a ſpeciall means which the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the encreaſe and furtheranee of his peoples faith.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2 To <hi>reprove</hi> divers perſons. 1. All ſuch as adventure to this Sacrament, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualified with ſaving faith; How can
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:119999:181"/>ſuch perſons expect an encreaſe of that which they are not at all poſſeſſed of? nay, what have ſuch to do at the Lords Table? The truth is, they have no call unto it; but in coming, they partake unworthily in a high degree. If ſuch as are true believers may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take unworthily (as is very evident in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) How unworthily do they partake? alas, what do all ſuch when they receive, but exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophane this holy ordinance? And that this is no little ſin, do but ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. that is, <hi>guilty of the death of Chriſt.</hi> Now it is a great ſin to be guilty of the death of any man; but to be guilty of the death of an innocent man, of the death of the innocent Lamb of God, of his death who was God as well as man; how foul and horrible a crime is this? If the death of <hi>Abel</hi> did lie ſo heavily upon the conſcience of <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.13. How ſhould the death of the Son of God lie heavy upon their conſciences that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof? And the Apoſtle tels us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>unworthily</hi> (as they muſt needs do in a high degree, that have no meaſure of ſaving faith) is to be <hi>guilty of the death of Chriſt:</hi> His meaning is, that all ſuch as receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily; doe (upon the matter) conſent unto the horrible fact of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the Jewes,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:119999:182"/>in their crucifying of Chriſt. But this is the miſery, that men and women will not beleeve the word of God, but their own thoughts, and conceits; what they will ſay, or at leaſt think. Are we not baptized perſons? Do we not profeſs the Goſpel? Do we not come to the Church? And do we not come in our intents and meanings, to receive good at the Lords Table? And will you make us guilty of the ſame ſin that <hi>Judas</hi> and the Jewes were in their crucifying of Chriſt, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to that bloodie and horrible fact of theirs?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the Apoſtle affirms no leſſe of all unworthy receivers. And it is an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth which you have heard; that all who are not qualified with ſome meaſure of ſaving faith, receive unworthily in a high degree.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Oh then, firſt we ſee all perſons groſly ignorant (coming to the Lords Supper) to be in a woful caſe; there can be no ſaving faith in ſuch: this faith ever preſuppoſing ſome meaſure of knowledg in the myſteries of religion. Alas! how many approach to this Sacrament, and cannot tell what a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is; what this Sacrament is; what are the ends why this Sacrament was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; neither how it ſhould be received?</p>

                  <p n="3">3. See we many others (partaking at the Lords Table) to be in a wofull caſe, ſuch as have ſome meaſure of knowledg; and it may be are of civil converſation. But they are inward oppoſers of ſincere preaching, and ſo of ſincere profeſſors; they would either have no preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, or elſe eſpecially approve of that which doth the moſt tickle the ear. And ſo for profeſſors of religion that are forward, they have no mind, no affection unto them; think they are but half witted people, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and turbulent; have no delight in their company. Now ſuch perſons are far from the grace aforeſaid. And this one thing I would have you to take notice of; many we have, that are very forward after the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their kind, needs they muſt receive at Eaſter however; and yet have no deſire after the powerfull preaching of the Word, care not much whether they ever hear a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull

That that we would give you to underſtand of ſuch perſons, is this; that their deſire after the Sacrament is not a kindly deſire, and from Gods Spirit; but a popiſh, prepoſterous, and corrupt deſire. Thus we have reproved the unregenerate and unbeleevers adventuring to the Lords Table; and as you have ſeen <hi>their ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. ſo you may the <hi>puniſhment</hi> attending them for the ſame, ver. 29. that is, <hi>Judgment;</hi> temporall, eternall, if they do not truly and ſeriouſly repent for it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond branch of this uſe of reproofe extends it ſelf to divers who are qualified with ſome meaſure of ſaving faith. Firſt, (the Lords Supper being ſuch an excellent means to <hi>encreaſe</hi> and confirme faith) that they do no more <hi>frequent</hi> it; when as they might often partake conſcionably, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; no impediment being in the way but their ignorance, ſloth, or this needleſſe fear, or that. 1. Their <hi>ignorance,</hi> not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiving information what an excellent help this would be to their faith and other graces: and how the Lord commands them to receive often; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.6.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119999:183"/>which is required of thoſe that receive worthily: as though this were ſo difficult a thing to thoſe that uſe a daily examination, and upon occaſion inure themſelves to cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of humiliation. Or 3, <hi>This or that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe fear:</hi> As haply, becauſe their faith is ſo little, and therfore that they ſhould not receive worthily: Whereas this ſhould great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induce them to haſten to this feaſt of fulneſs for the ſtrengthening and encreaſe of that they complain to be ſo little: the Sacrament being the proper portion of ſuch, eſpecially belonging unto thoſe truely ſenſible of their wants. If we look at the firſt celebration of this ordinance, we ſhall upon examination find, that our Saviour did adminiſter to thoſe that were far from perfection; nay full of infirmities. And thus we reprove divers true beleevers 1. for not coming <hi>oft enough</hi> to the Lords Supper, no juſt impediment lying in their way. 2. To reprove divers true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who come (and it may be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to the Sacrament; but it is in a cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, a ſleepy careleſſe way, do not reex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their faith, do not (by <hi>extraordinary prayer</hi>) ſo ſtir up their graces, as befits them in the act of receiving, do not earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſpirituall conſideration; ſummon their outward ſenſes and inward affections to attend
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:119999:184"/>the whole buſineſſe in hand. And after they have received, little obſerve the fruit of their receiving: Now ſuch are to know, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in this manner at the Lords Table, they partake unworthily in a degree. And hence it comes to paſſe, that they are ſo far from gaining ſpiritual ſtrength by this ordinance, as they occaſion the Lord to bring divers temporall judgments upon them; as we may ſee in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. Oh therefore let all ſuch know, they have great cauſe to mourn for what is paſt, and better to look to the matter for time to come. And thus we have done with the uſe of reproof.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. To exhort all true believers in coming to the Lords Table, that they earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to come <hi>preparedly,</hi> that ſo they may receive worthily (that is to ſay) accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to God; and then no queſtion it will prove a profitable receiving to their own ſouls. Many true beleevers receive unworthily in ſome degree, and fail much of the good they might receive by this ordinance for want of due <hi>preparation;</hi> they are too ſlight in <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination:</hi> and for <hi>extraordinary praier</hi> to be performed ſometime before the day of their receiving, they are too backwward unto, and too careleſſe in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To exhort them <hi>in the act of receiving,</hi> that they labour to <hi>diſcern the Lords body;</hi> that is, put a difference, and diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the outward elements, and common bread and wine; although not in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, why yet in their uſe; and ſo ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intend the whole buſineſſe, ſtirring up their inward affections by a ſerious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their outward ſenſes; that ſo Chriſt and his benefits may be received and welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the armes of their enlarged and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended faith. Many believers, <hi>in the act</hi> of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119999:185"/>receiving, fail much in ſpirituall conſideration, and ſo their affections are little moved and inflamed. If 1. When the Miniſter ſets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Elements, thou wouldſt conſider that even ſo God the Father from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity did ſet apart Chriſt to be the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mankind. 2. When he conſecrates the Elements by the Word and Prayer, thou wouldſt conſider that even ſo in the fulneſs of time, God ſent his Son into the world to accompliſh this work of Redemption. 3. When thou ſeeſt the Miniſter to break the Bread, and powr out the Wine, thou wouldſt meditate upon the accurſed death of Chriſt, and ſhedding of his bloud for all true Believers. 4. When the Miniſter comes and gives the Bread and Wine unto thee, if thou wouldſt conſider that even ſo God the Father reaches and gives his Son and all his merits unto thy faith. 5. When thou takeſt and receiveſt the Elements at the Miniſters hands, thou wouldſt ſtir up thy ſelf to apprehend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt and his benefits by the hand of faith. And then ſixthly, and laſtly, In eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking the Elements, thou wouldſt earneſtly endeavour more and more nearly to apply Chriſt, and to feel thy Spiritual union with him: Such conſideration <hi>in the act of receiving,</hi> would be the way not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:119999:186"/>the <hi>Sign,</hi> but at one and the ſame time the <hi>thing ſignified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 To exhort all true Believers <hi>after</hi> they have received: 1. To labour to keep up their faith, aſſuring themſelves the Lord is no deceiver; but will be ſure to make good his Covenant with them. 2. As we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard; ſometime that day in ſecret take a review of thy receiving, and after it proceed as thou haſt been directed. 3. Remember to make good thy Vows, and to demonſtrate both to thy ſelf and others, that thou haſt got Spiritual ſtrength by this Feaſt of growth; thou walking more conſcionably and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably in both Callings. Its ſaid of the fainting <hi>Egyptian,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.11, 12. when he had eaten and drunk, that his <hi>ſpirit came again to him:</hi> So if thou eat and drink in faith, thy Spiritual life will be revived, and thy ſtrength increaſed.</p>

                  <p>THis Member acquaints us with another good outward meanes whereby faith is encreaſed, to wit, <hi>Prayer.</hi> And hence we commend this Point of Doctrine unto you:</p>
                  <p>Doctr. <hi>Prayer is one good meanes for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of faith.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> So the father of the poſſeſſed child thought <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. And the Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5. and <hi>Jude</hi> 20. <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is, by the help and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; this being an excellent meanes to confirm and bring on faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. This is a good means to encreaſe any grace of Gods Spirit in us, and therefore a good means to encreaſe our faith. That it is a good means to encreaſe any grace of God Spirit in us, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to them that ask it?</hi> that is, the Holy Spirit in a greater meaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Hereby faith is exerciſed; to wit, by faithful Prayer, and the more faith is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, the more it growes and encreaſes,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:119999:187"/>
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.8, 9. ſee we the former part of the ſame Pſalm, and we ſhall obſerve <hi>Davids</hi> faith to get up in Prayer: So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62.2, 6.</p>

                     <hi>R.</hi> 3 The Rule of Contraries: This duty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and neglected, faith goes out of exerciſe, ſlackens and decayes. Now we come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1 For <hi>Tryal and Examination:</hi> 1 Do we uſe Prayer? if we pray ſeldom or never, let us not wonder if we be poor in the grace of faith; Prayer being the key that opens all Gods Treaſures. Such as are ſtrangers to Prayer, cannot be throughly acquainted with faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But do we uſe to pray? then in Prayer are we earneſt after faith for an encreaſe of this grace? Many in prayer are more for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things then Spiritual: but this is to pray in a carnal manner. And divers in prayer that beg ſpiritual Bleſſings, and yet ſue for them but in a carnal way; not ſeeing any beauty and excellency in them, neither finding any taſte or relliſh in them; but only becauſe they are convinced they cannot be ſaved without them. So then the Queſtion is. Whether in Prayer we be more earneſt for faith, and the other Graces of Gods Spirit, then for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings. And then in ſuing for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:119999:187"/>Bleſſings; whether the beauty we ſee in them, and relliſh we find in them, do much induce and move us to be earneſt at the Throne of Grace for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do we uſe Prayer? and in prayer are we earneſt for faith in the manner aforeſaid? obſerve we then the fruit of our praying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>He will ſpeak peace to his Saints;</hi> to wit, by ſtirring up and encreaſing their faith. Surely, ſuing for faith, as aforeſaid, we ſhall (upon examination) find an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it. And this is the great wheel in the Clock; come on in this grace, and come on in every ſanctifying and ſaving grace.</p>

As firſt, What Prayer is, and the parts of it? 2. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of prayer, and the Motives to it. 3. The Objections againſt Prayer, and the Anſwers of them. 4. The Qualifications of true and acceptable prayer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>What prayer is,</hi> and the parts of it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are not now ſpeaking of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and ſuits we make one to another (in our civil converſe here in the world) which may be called civil prayer. But of Religious
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:119999:188"/>Praier which we thus deſcribe. <hi>It is an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the deſire of the heart,</hi> or <hi>a pouring out of the foul to the Lord.</hi> 1. I ſay, It is an <hi>opening of the deſire of the heart,</hi> or a <hi>pouring out of the ſoul.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſay, It is a pouring out of the ſoul <hi>to the Lord,</hi> he only being the object of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious praier: it is he and he only that ſees and knows the heart: he and he only which is preſent in all places, to hear the praiers of all his people: he and he only which is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to help.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Parts</hi> of praier. In Scripture we find divers diviſions of prayer: but in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. we have the parts of praier punctually laid down: 1. Supplication. 2. Precation, or petition. 3. Interceſſion. 4. Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. By ſupplication we underſtand hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuit to the Lord for his favour, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin; and in this part of praier, we have the confeſſion of ſin implied. By preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or petition, the ſecond part of praier, we underſtand a begging of all other things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for ſoul and body. By Interceſſion, the third part of praier, we do not underſtand an entreating for others (as divers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors doe) for not only this part of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but all the parts of praier are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to be performed, as in the behalf
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119999:188"/>of our ſelves, why ſo in the behalf of others. But we underſtand by it a contending with God for the prevention and removall of judgment. By Thankſgiving, the laſt part of praier, we underſtand a rendring praiſe to God for his bleſſings and mercies. Thus then we ſee that prayer conſiſts of 4 parts, Supplication, Precation, Interceſſion, and Thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer, to wit, What <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it, and the motives unto it.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It is an excellent part of Gods <hi>worſhip Pſal.</hi> 95.6. where, by <hi>bowing down</hi> and calling upon God, is meant, to <hi>worſhip</hi> him. Hence the place of Gods worſhip (by way of excellencie) was called the <hi>houſe of prayer, Iſa.</hi> 56.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the duty of prayer the Lord is much glorified; for hereby, all his attributes are acknowledged: Trinity in Unity, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Trinity confeſſed: The puritie and holineſſe of his Law ſubſcribed unto: His promiſes in the Goſpel profeſſed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the accompliſhment of them to be hoped for, and expected: and he bleſſed and praiſed for his mercies.</p>

And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David,</hi> although it were revealed to him that the Lord would eſtabliſh his houſe, and the kingdom upon his poſterity, yet doth not ceaſe to pray in that kind, but rather pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.11, 12, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I anſwer, Although by prayer we cannot alter Gods decree, why yet by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (it being hearty and holy) we alter our ſelves; the heart thereby being put into a fitting frame, and ſo we made capable of Gods bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3 But there be divers men and women that are far from the practice of true and kindly prayer, who enjoy the bleſſings of God in great abundance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, but yet ſanctifying grace (which is the beſt bleſſing) they do
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:119999:190"/>not enjoy the leaſt meaſure of it: ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace and kindly praier, they ever go together; want the one, and want the other; and have the one, and have the other. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. It is but outward bleſſings, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graces at the moſt, which unpraying perſons do enjoy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe bleſſings which the perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid do enjoy, they enjoy them rather for the good of <hi>others,</hi> then for the good of <hi>themſelves;</hi> ſuppoſe health, wealth, ſtrength, wit, learning. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a man of great parts and power; but was it not for the good of the Church, rather then for his own good? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a great difference betwixt the having of bleſſings through the <hi>providence</hi> of God, and the having them from the <hi>mercy</hi> of God, and his ſpeciall love in Chriſt. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praying perſons have bleſſings only the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way, and not in mercy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The bleſſings ſuch have, it were better for them to be without them, they proving but ſnares unto them; and they living to abuſe them to their owne utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4 But there be divers that uſe prayer, and have prayed for this and that bleſſing a long time but yet come ſhort of it.</p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:119999:191"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This may be true; and for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and upon the grounds following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It may be the parties we ſpeak of, live in ſome known ſin, or ſins, unrepented of; and then what promiſe have they of audience? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>Job</hi> 11.13.14.</p>
                  <p>Or 2. It may be they ask ſuch things as would not be good for them to enjoy; and then it is no unkindneſſe, but love in the Lord, to deny them. See we how the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe runs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11.</p>
                  <p>Or 3. It may be they ask in an evill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; in their praiers prefer temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to ſpirituall; or if they be earneſt for ſpirituall bleſſings, it is not becauſe of the excellencie and beauty of them; but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the neceſſity of them, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them they cannot be ſaved. Or it may be, they ask heedleſly, and irreverently; do not conſider of the Lords majeſty and greatneſſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. and 5.7. Or it may be they ask coldly and faintly, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. and are ſuch ſuitors like to ſpeed? Or it may be they go in a proud way to God, as the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. not with a through ſenſe of their own unworthineſſe and wants, as the Publican and Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. and 15.21. Or elſe it may be, they do not ask in faith; that is, do not lay the promiſes before them, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:119999:191"/>their confidence upon them. Or do not in their prayres ſet before them the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of their advocate and high Preiſt, who ſits at his fathers right hand to preſent their prayers unto him, and to make them acceptable unto him. Now the perſons we are ſpeaking of, asking in an evil manner (to wit, in the manner aforeſaid) it is no wonder that they ſpeed no better, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3.</p>
                  <p>Or 4. Suppoſe they do not live in any known ſin unrepented of; and that the things which they ask would be good for them in Gods time, and that they pray in a right manner. Suppoſe all theſe things; why yet there may be divers good reaſons why the Lord doth defer and delay them. As 1. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make trial of their faith, as we may ſee in the woman of <hi>Canaan, Matth.</hi> 15.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Although the Lord did intend to grant her ſuit; yet he deferred her, and put her off long; and all for the trial of her faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Or 2. He defers them the more to humble them; He intended to take from <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>meſſenger of Satan wherewith he was b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffeted;</hi> but not ſo ſoon as he would have had it, <hi>Paul</hi> was not yet ſufficiently humbled, but in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to have been puffed up with his former revelations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8.9. As if the Lord had ſaid; it is too ſoon for thee <hi>(Paul)</hi> to be
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:119999:192"/>rid of that thorn; thou muſt be brought to a greater pitch of humilliation. Or 3. He defers them to make them more earneſt and importunate in prayer, as we may ſee in the examples before alledged (to wit the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>) Or 4. He defers them leſt they ſhould think that they merited by their prayers (although never ſo fervent.) <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17, 18, 19. Or 5. He defers them that they might be more able to uſe, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age thoſe bleſſings he means to beſtow upon them. This was one cauſe why he deferred to bring <hi>David</hi> to the kingdome, that he might be the better able to manage it when he came to be poſſeſſed of it. 6. Or laſtly, He defers them that he might cauſe them to account more highly of the good things they obtain of him by prayer. The good things that are eaſily and readily come by, are uſually lightly eſteemed: After the Spouſe had loſt her welbeloved long, it is ſaid, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. <hi>She held him &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. And in the laſt place, for anſwering of the objection; we are to know, that the Lord grants requeſts divers waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When he gives the particular bleſſing begged. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When denying the particular thing beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he gives a better thing. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:119999:192"/>19, And 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16. compared with verſe 24.25 of the ſame chapter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When though he neither grant the thing begged, nor a better thing in the ſame kind; why yet he ſupporteth by his grace, and giveth ſtrength to beare the want of it. As 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 138.3. <hi>Hebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> 5.7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the particular bleſſing begged is not given and afforded; why yet the Lord warmes and cheeres the heart, by aſſuring that the perſon and prayer is accepted, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, When the particular bleſſing is not obtained, neither inward comfort affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and yet the Lord gives to hold out in prayer: abilitie and ſtrength to pray when God ſeemeth to neglect, is a ſpeciall work and fruit of Gods Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. Now God cannot but hear and regard the voice of his own ſpirit: for <hi>verſe</hi> 27. he <hi>knoweth,</hi> that is, approveth it. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. See alſo thus have we anſwered the main objections againſt prayer.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the fourth thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded touching prayer, to wit, the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications</hi> of true and acceptable prayer: or the conditions, and requiſites of acceptable prayer.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:119999:193"/>
                  <p>Firſt, the perſon or party praying muſt be <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and ſuch an one as doth not live in the practice of any known ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. <hi>God had reſpect</hi> firſt to <hi>Abel,</hi> and then <hi>to his offering.</hi> See <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. If the party be not in Chriſt, or evangelically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, he hath no promiſe of audience: or if the partie live in the practiſe of any known ſin, what promiſe of audience? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31. <hi>God heareth not ſinners:</hi> that is, living in the practice of known ſin. So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we would put up acceptable prayers, we muſt make ſure that our ſuits and requeſts be grounded upon the word, that we ask nothing but what the word of God warrants us to ask: we muſt not ask as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good unto our ſelves; but according to Gods will, and as his word alloweth. The ſons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> and their mother were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.22. becauſe they asked they knew not what; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we would have our prayers accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, we muſt come before him in all humility, that is, with a lively ſenſe and feeling of our own unworthineſſe and wants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God gives grace,</hi> ſhews favour <hi>to the humble.</hi> Thus <hi>Jacob, Gen</hi> 32.10. and the Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 If we would have our prayers accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:119999:193"/>and prevalent, we muſt put them up with fervency and importunity, <hi>James</hi> 5.16 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17. This fervency not ſo much conſiſting 1. in the loudneſs of the voyce, as in the wreſtling of the heart. <hi>Moſes</hi> uttered never a word, <hi>Exodus</hi> 14.15. and yet great was the fruit of his Prayer; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This fervency ariſing, not onely from a ſenſe of want, but likewiſe from a hope of prevailing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This fervency being mingled with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, we having good ends in this or that we would obtain of the Lord by Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. and not that we may conſume it on our luſts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, This fervency bounding and terminating it ſelf in a willing ſubmiſſion unto Gods wiſe Decree; we refering the time and manner of Gods accompliſhing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts unto his good pleaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1. It was the ſin of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that <hi>they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the holy One of Iſrael;</hi> Pſalm 78.41: they preſeribed to the Lord <hi>what</hi> they would have for their proviſion, and <hi>when</hi> they would have it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If we would have our Prayers accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prevalent, we muſt make ſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them in the Name, Merit, and Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt. This is the condition of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:119999:194"/>condition; come we never ſo well qualified to prayer, we can have no boldneſs in it, this condition being omitted; there being ſo great a diſtance betwixt God and us, his Majeſty and Holineſs, and our ſinfulneſs and vileneſs; nothing being due to us and our beſt prayers in our own names, but ſhame and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all the former qualifications do but, make way for this condition; this being the principal requiſite of acceptable prayer: To this purpoſe ſee <hi>John</hi> 16.23. the latter part of the verſe; and <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. Upon this Altar we muſt lay the ſacrifice of our prayers; it is this Prieſt that muſt preſent them to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may be acceptable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If we would have our prayers accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prevalent, we muſt ask in faith; I mean, confidently believing, that (according to Gods promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7.) we ſhall be heard, our prayers granted in ſome kind, <hi>James</hi> 1.5. and 6.7. <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.24.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Laſtly, If we would have our prayers acceptable and prevalent, we muſt take heed of omitting thankſgiving; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.14, 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. Thankfulneſs for former favours, is an excellent means to prevail in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent requeſts.</p>
                  <p>Thus much as touching the fifth Principle.</p>

Becauſe every man and woman hath that in them, which is the cauſe of death, to wit, ſin; it is that which is as poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the ſpirits, and as rottenneſs in the bones: ſin brought in death, even Chriſt himſelf, although he did never ſin, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he became our Surety, ſtood guilty of our ſin, death ſeiz'd upon him. Now we come to anſwer ſome objections, and then to the Uſes.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But we read of ſome perſons, of ſome particular men, that did not dye; as <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. and <hi>Elijah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.11.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The perſons forementioned had that, which to them was in ſtead of death; to wit, a change. Although they did not dye after the manner of other men, yet it was with them, as it ſhall be with thoſe who ſhall be found alive at Chriſts ſecond comming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51, 52. they ſhall have a ſudden, and almoſt unperceivable change, which to them ſhall be in ſtead of death.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. There is a promiſe made, <hi>John</hi> 11.26. that thoſe that believe in Chriſt ſhall <hi>never dye.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>Eternally:</hi> the true Believer ſhall not dye eternally. And for corporal death, the nature of it is altered; the ſting of it is taken away to ſuch a party, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. Now to the Uſes.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For <hi>Reprehenſion,</hi> and it conſiſts of divers Members or Branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To reprove all ſuch, as immoderately and exceſſively mourn for their deceaſed friends, death being the common condition of all men: This was <hi>Davids</hi> failing, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:119999:197"/>went over in paſſion, when newes was brought unto him of the death of his ſon <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. Although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what he might be excuſed, becauſe his ſon dyed ſo doubtfully (as touching his future eſtate) which (no queſtion) did aggravate <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrow; for then indeed have we the moſt cauſe to ſorrow and mourn, when our Children, Kindred, and Friends are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by death in the act of ſin, or before ever they began to dye to ſin: yet in this caſe did <hi>Aaron</hi> quietly and patiently ſubmit unto Gods diſpoſing hand, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelf, another Child of his, dying, (of whom he had more hope, and better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) carries the matter a great deal more patiently and chearfully, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22, 23. Nay <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. Indeed many (their Friends, Kindred, Children dying doubtfully in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their future condition) have great cauſe to mourn, becauſe they themſelves gave them no better example, gave them no more inſtruction to further them in religious wayes. And ſo divers, that have had religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friends taken from them by death, have great cauſe to mourn, becauſe they made no better uſe of their good example and holy ſociety, when they enjoyed them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To reprove ſuch as offend in the other
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:119999:198"/>extreme, ſee their husbands, wives, children, kindred, nay hundreds taken away by death, but little lay it to heart, do not make a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Application of it to themſelves, contrary to that, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.2. Alas, many are like Stocks and Blocks, who when they ſee this party and that dye, nay multitudes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, do not ſay within themſelves, my turn will come ere long; the time is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, when I and my outward eſtate muſt be parted, when I and my friends muſt be parted, when my ſoul and body muſt be parted; and ſo labour more and more to fit themſelves for death: imitating <hi>Moſes,</hi> who obſerving many in the Wilderneſs to be taken away by death, cryes out, <hi>O teach us to number our dayes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. Nay, although they ſee divers of the godly taken away by death, (which is ever a forerunner of wrath and judgement) yet do not lay it to heart as befits them: See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To reprove all thoſe, that wholly (or for the moſt part) do ſet their love and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the things of this world, proſecute and purſue outward things, as though they were alwayes to enjoy them; not weighing the point in hand, neither the uncertain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that attend this certainty, <hi>time, place,</hi> and <hi>manner:</hi> As for the <hi>time,</hi> no man
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:119999:198"/>knoweth when he ſhall dye; in the night, or in the day; in winter, or in ſummer; in youth, or in his latter age. And ſo for <hi>piace,</hi> no man knows where he ſhall dye, whether at home, or abroad; in his bed, or in the field; in the Market, or in the Church. And ſo for the <hi>manner</hi> or kind of death, no man knows how he ſhall dye; whether ſuddenly, or by a lingring ſickneſs; whether by a violent hand, or by a natural courſe. And yet to ſee how men and women heap up this thick clay, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently labour to feather their neſts here in the world; and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.11. And ſo the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Iſaiah</hi> 28.15. And we may obſerve no leſs in that fool, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. Whereas on the contrary, men and women ſhould imitate <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 14.14. and be adviſed by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, &amp;c. A man abuſeth the world, when he looks upon worldly things, as things that he ſhall enjoy alwayes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To reprove all ſuch, as cannot endure to think of death, to be told of death: You ſtrike them into a melancholy fit, when you put them in mind of their death; thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are far from imitating thoſe Worthies in Scripture, whom we read to have made their Sepulchres in their life time; as <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. Nay, in their Gardens, (the place of their ſolace and delight) as <hi>Joſeph</hi>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:119999:199"/>of <hi>Aramathea, John</hi> 19.41. Nay, thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come ſhort of ſome of the Heathen we read of, as <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mocritus,</hi> who was wont to walk among the graves, that ſo he might the better meditate upon death. And ſo it is reported of thoſe Philoſophers called <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae,</hi> that they were ſo much given to think upon death, that they had their graves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before their gates; that both going out, and coming in, they might be put in mind of their latter end. And ſo the antient <hi>Aegyptians</hi> (in the midſt of their mirth at their ſolemn ſeaſts) were wont to have the image of Death brought in and laid before them, with theſe words, <hi>Hoc intuens, epulare; Beholding this Image, eat and drink;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a means they uſed to make them eat and drink more moderately. And ſurely one ſpecial cauſe why the moſt are ſo unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for death, is becauſe they have no deſire to think of it to be put in mind of it. And thus now we have done with the uſe of <hi>reprehenſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For <hi>Information;</hi> to inform us, that although death be unavoidable, why yet we muſt be ſo far from haſtning our own death, by neglecting the means of life, or by laying violent hands upon our ſelves, as we muſt uſe all good means for the preſerving of our natural life, and lengthening our dayes here
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:119999:199"/>upon earth, (and all this implyed in the ſixth precept.) Not that we deny, but that (in ſome caſes) a man or a woman may deſire death rather then life: As 1. When they are thoroughly convinced, and ſufficiently reſolved, that the Lord ſhall have more glory by their dying, then by their living: No queſtion this was one reaſon, why <hi>Samſon</hi> deſired death; he knowing, that thereby he ſhould ſlay more of Gods enemies, then he had done in all his life time: and hence it was, that the holy Martyrs heretofore did ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly dye, nay did ſo joyfully deſire death; becauſe they were perſwaded, that God ſhould have ſo much glory by their death. 2. In conſideration that they cannot live here on earth, but daily offend their good and gracious God: to deſire death in this caſe, is not a loathing to live, but a loathing to ſin; and ſo much is implyed in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> his exclamation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. 3. In conſideration that they cannot live in this world, but ſee and hear the Lord much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by the wicked: this was that which did ſo vex the ſoul of righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. And no queſtion this was one ſpecial cauſe, why <hi>Elijah</hi> deſired death; to wit, the wickedneſs of the times he lived in. And ſo <hi>Rebecka,</hi> the wickedneſs of her Daughter in
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:119999:200"/>law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.34, 35.27.46. 4. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that until death, they are abſent from Chriſt, do not ſo fully and perfectly enjoy him, as they ſhall do after death. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8 <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23. Nay, ſo the whole Church is brought in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. Now in the caſes aforeſaid, it is lawful for a man or a woman to deſire death, rather then life, not that they may neglect the means of life, or haſten their own death, (this way or that way) no nor impatiently wiſh death; this was the fault of the old <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.3. Nay, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf (this way) failed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.15. And did not <hi>Rachel, Gen.</hi> 30.1. And ſo <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 8. And what more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in theſe times, then for men and women (when great calamity is upon them, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent) impatiently to wiſh death. Thus much for this Uſe, the Uſe of <hi>Information.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. For <hi>Exhortation:</hi> and it conſiſts of divers parts or branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To exhort every one of us (ſeeing death is unavoidable, cannot be avoided) much to think, and often to meditate (and that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) upon our own death; and this being done of us, it will be a good means to prevent much evil in our practice; and much to put us on in the wayes of goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>To prevent much evil in our practice: as</p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:119999:200"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Diſſoluteneſs, or looſneſs of life: Durſt any man give himſelf liberty to be drunk, if he ſeriouſly weighed, he might be ſtruck with death whiles he is drunk, as <hi>Elah</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.9, 10. Or durſt any man commit uncleanneſs, if he could ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly think of this, that God might ſtrike him ſuddenly while he is in that filthy act, as he did <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Coſbi? Numb.</hi> 25.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A frequent and ſerious meditation of our own death, will be a good means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our vigorous and cruel proceedings with others; ſee <hi>Job</hi> 31.13, 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.48, 49. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This will be a good means to prevent our over-love, and immoderate uſe of outward things: To this purpoſe is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. If we do not ſee death ſtand at the end of all our earthly profits, at the end of all our worldly pleaſures, we ſhall too eagarly purſue them; and having obtained them, ſhall too much ſolace our ſelves in them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This will be a good means to prevent the danger of death; I mean, to take away the ſting and terror of it, death being like unto the <hi>Baſilisk;</hi> if it ſee thee before thou ſeeſt it, it will be thy death; but if thou ſee it firſt, thou wilt be the death of it.</p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:119999:201"/>
                  <p>And as the frequent and ſerious meditation of our own death, will be a good means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent much evil in our practice; ſo likewiſe it will be a good means much to further us in the wayes of goodneſs: as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby we ſhall be minded to be more painful and profitable in our places, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereby we ſhall be made more meek, and patient in all our ſufferings and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5. <hi>James</hi> 5.7, 8. This is that which will make quiet in all provocations: This'is that which will comfort in all diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements: I ſhall ſhortly be ſent for, I ſhall ſhortly be called from hence; then I ſhall be righted then I ſhall be cleared, then I ſhall have reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hereby we ſhall be made more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the thing being ſo certain, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſo uncertain, (as time, place, and manner) See <hi>Mark</hi> 13.35. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, this will be a good means to work in us a care to prepare for death. A man that ſeriouſly concludes he muſt dye, will not that man go about to ſet his houſe in order, his heart in order, all in order? And thus now we have done with the firſt part, or branch of this Uſe, which hath been
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:119999:201"/>to exhort every one of us much to think, and often to meditate (and that ſeriouſly) upon our own death, which (as you may perceive) will not be a little advantageous in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond part or branch of this Uſe is, to exhort us (every one of us) ſeeing death is unavoidable, cannot be avoided, that we would labour to prepare and fit our ſelves for death. But before we come to hold forth the means, we will propound ſome <hi>Motives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Now the firſt Motive we have in the Doctrine it felf; <hi>death is unavoidable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 2. This is the main errand of our life. God did not ſend us into this world to ſin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o glut our ſelves with the creature, but to bring him ſome honour, and then to dye. The Factor is not imployed to take his pleaſure abroad, but to negotiate for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and then to return home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 3. Death is but once; and that ſtands in need to be well done, which can be but once done; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. once, and no more. An Hour-glaſs, when it is run out, may be turn'd again; but in this caſe it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 4. When death hath done with thee, then God will begin with thee. Thou muſt once dye, and after this come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:119999:202"/>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. Then no more praying, no more faſting, no more any Prophet to come unto thee in the Name of the Lord: thou ſhalt not lye a few years in flames of wrath, and then get leave to come out, that thou mayeſt amend thy life: Oh no! if once there, for ever there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 5. Laſtly, conſider with thy ſelf, it will be as much as thou canſt do, to do the work of death; therefore prepare, and get all thy other work done before. Then haply thy friends about thee (loath to part with thee, and thou with them) will diſquiet thee, extremity of pain will be upon thee, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex thee, Satan buſie with thee, thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence active and ſtirring: It is no little, no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie work, to do the work of death.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the <hi>Motives:</hi> Now to come to the <hi>Means,</hi> whereby to prepare and fit our ſelves for death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means.</hi> 1. We muſt make ſure to repent of all our known ſins; that is, call them to mind, unfainedly bewail them, heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them, earheſtly crave pardon of them, purpoſing by Gods help to forſake them all. Such as dye impenitently, dye in their ſins; and that is a woful and a lamentable dying, as our Saviour tels the Jewes, <hi>John</hi> 8.21, 24.</p>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:119999:202"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means</hi> 2. We muſt make ſure of Chriſt, that Chriſt is ours, that we are clothed with his Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56, 57. If thou haſt got Chriſt into thine armes by faith, thou may'ſt boldly look death in the face, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36, 37. <hi>Phil</hi> 1.21. Having a good Chriſt, thou may'ſt be confident of a good death; <hi>Luke</hi> 2.28, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means</hi> 3. If we would be ſitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death, we muſt make ſure to have renewed natures; ſuch being onely fitted for the <hi>Bridegrooms coming,</hi> as have <hi>Oyl in their Lamps;</hi> (An outward proſeſſion will not ſerve the turn, unleſs we have that we make profeſſion of) See <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.6. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come.</hi> If a man have got the Spirit (the ſanctifying graces of Gods Spirit) into his ſoul, to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it, as the Bride is with her Ornaments, why then he may ſay to Death, <hi>Come,</hi> and to Chriſt, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means</hi> 4. That we may be prepared for death, we muſt learn to bear (and that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and patiently) the croſſes and troubles, wherewith the Lord is pleaſed daily to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe us. ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37, 38. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. And ſo the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. that he did <hi>dye daily:</hi> his meaning is, that (by his patient and willing bearing of thoſe
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:119999:203"/>daily croſſes he was ſubject unto) he learned every day to dye. So think with thy ſelf, If I cannot endure a little, how ſhall I endure more? If I cannot endure a light croſs, a ſmall affliction, how ſhall I bear the pangs of death when they come? As <hi>Agamemnon</hi> firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> by wraſtling, and then by fighting: And <hi>Bilney</hi> (the Martyr) firſt burned his finger in the Candle, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he might the better endure the burning of his whole body at the ſtake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means</hi> 5. We muſt labour for heavenly-mindedneſs, ſit looſe to the creature, have in us a holy indifferency concerning all things ſublunary. That which the Apoſtle ſaith of the love of money, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. that it is <hi>The root of all evil;</hi> and the cauſe why many are even <hi>pierced thorow with many ſorrowes</hi> (the truth whereof is never more ſeen then on their death-beds) may be likewiſe ſaid of the love of any other worldly thing; (the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, which is the Apoſtles meaning in the place cited) and therefore the counſel is good, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62.10. <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Doct. <hi>It is a moſt certain truth, that there ſhall be a general Reſurrection: That all the dead ſhall riſe again with their own bodies at the laſt day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scriptures are very clear and evident in this point. See <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 26.19. <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.15.</p>
                  <p>The Grounds and Reaſons of the Doctrine. And firſt we will lay you down Reaſons, why the bodies of the <hi>godly</hi> muſt be raiſed again at the laſt day; and then, why the bodies of the <hi>wicked</hi> muſt be then raiſed.</p>
                  <p>Reaſons why the bodies of the godly muſt be raiſed again at the laſt day:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Lord is their God, is in Covenant with the godly, in Covenant with the whole man; not onely ſoul, but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This is our Saviours Argument to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who denied the Reſurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>As touching the Reſurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying, I am the God of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob? <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> Our Saviours meaning is this, The God of Heaven ſpeaking to <hi>Moſes</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.9.) of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> (who being in Covenant with God, but all dead long before the Lord then ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet) ſpeaks
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:119999:205"/>of them as alive; thereby intimating the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of their bodies, that their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould be raiſed again at the laſt day; and if their bodies, why then the dead bodies of all that are in Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2 Chriſt himſelf hath undertaken this; to wit, to raiſe up the dead bodies of all his at the laſt day, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. And is not this an eaſie thing with him, he being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, but God? See <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Chriſt is riſen, therefore the dead bodies of all the godly ſhall riſe again at the laſt day. This is a true and ſure conſequence: for 1. Chriſt roſe again, that he might raiſe them. 2. Chriſt is their Head, and they his Members: ſeeing then Chriſt their Head is riſen, they alſo his Members doubtleſs ſhall riſe; for the glory of the head requires this, that he have his members ſutable, and in like condition with himſelf. 3. The ſame Spirit is in them, which is in Chriſt raiſed; he joyneth and uniteth them with Chriſt, and worketh the ſame in them, which he doth in Chriſt; But he hath raiſed Chriſt, therefore he will raiſe them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. To this end the bodies of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect were made, that in them (as Temples) the Holy Ghoſt might dwell for ever; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:119999:205"/>their bodies ſhall riſe again at the laſt day, and live for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. This great truth denied, (that the bodies of the godly ſhall be raiſed again at the laſt day) overturns all Religion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. unto the nineteenth. Thus you ſee the Reaſons why the bodies of the <hi>godly</hi> muſt be raiſed again at the laſt day. Now we come to lay you down the Reaſons, why the bodies of the <hi>wicked</hi> muſt be raiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Scripture delivers this in plain and expreſs termes, 3 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The threatnings and comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that lie againſt the wicked; <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.43. and ſo to verſe 49. beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The Juſtice of God requires this. The wicked do not onely ſin in ſoul, but in body; therefore their bodies muſt be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the laſt day, that ſo they may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in both. Thus you ſee, that not only the dead bodies of the godly ſhall be raiſed again at the laſt day, but alſo the dead bodies of the wicked. Yet (obſerve) with a double difference: 1. In regard of the <hi>efficient.</hi> 2. In regard of the <hi>final cauſe.</hi> The bodies of the godly ſhall riſe by the power of Chriſt their Head; the bodies of the wicked, by the power
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:119999:206"/>of Chriſt their Judge: The bodies of the godly ſhall riſe to eternal glory, the bodies of the wicked, to eternal condemnation.</p>
                  <p>For the further opening of this Doctrine, we intend 1. To anſwer ſome objections. 2. In brief to lay before you the manner or method of the <hi>general Reſurrection.</hi> 3. And laſtly, the Uſes.</p>

Upon this ground, the godly heretofore in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſeries have comforted themſelves; See <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 26.19.

                  <p n="1">1. If we believe the Reſurrection of the body, we muſt be moderate in mourning for our Chriſtian friends deceaſed. Our Saviour Chriſt did weep for <hi>Lazarus:</hi> And when
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:119999:209"/>
                     <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned to death; ſome that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God buried him, and made great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him; and therefore mourning for the dead is not altogether unlawful; yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we muſt, what the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Doctrine of the Reſurrection, ſhould teach us to have the very body in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and not to tranſgreſs againſt it.

                  <p n="3">3. The conſideration of this great work of the Reſurrection of our bodies, ſhould teach us to truſt God in other matters, and believe his Promiſes, though there be never ſo great unlikelihood of the accompliſhment, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the outward means and appearance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. to the 22.</p>

And then we muſt make ſure of the firſt Reſurrection;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:119999:210"/>not onely pretend our ſelves to have faith, but make ſure it be, as a juſtifying, ſo a ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith; for ſo a juſtifying faith ever is.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Scriptures are very clear and abundant in proof of this point. Begin we with that antient teſtimony alledged in the Apoſtle <hi>Jude, Jude</hi> 14.15. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9, 10 <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> laſt

                     <hi>Object.</hi> May ſome man ſay, The whole world conſiſts of Believers and Unbelievers. But as touching Believers, it is ſaid <hi>John</hi> 5.24. that they ſhall not come <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. The firſt queſtion is, How this judgement is diſtinguiſhed from other judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial proceedings?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This we may let you ſee in divers Epithets given to this judgement: as 1. It is called <hi>the laſt judgement:</hi> (ſo the Catechiſme
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:119999:211"/>entitles it:) And ſo it is, for after it there ſhall be no other; the ſentence paſſed then, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reverſt; there can be no appeal from that Judge and judgement. 2. It is called <hi>the general judgement.</hi> God judgeth men and women in this world, and that both in life and death: He judgeth them whilſt they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by correcting his people for their ſcapes and infirmities, by puniſhing the wicked for their tranſgreſſions and rebellions. He judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man and woman at death. But then ſhall be a general judgement of all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. 3. It is called a <hi>manifeſt and open judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And ſo it ſhall be, for the proceedings then, ſhall be in the eye and view of all the world. 4. It is called a <hi>ſudden judgement:</hi> And ſo it ſhall be, in regard of the wicked; Even as the flood came upon the Old World, when they were wantonizing, and deriding that preacher of righteouſneſs. 5. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It is called an <hi>eternal judgement:</hi> Not that the Judge ſhall ſit for ever, ſifting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and debating cauſes; but it is ſo called, from the effect; for the iſſue will be this, The eternal weal and happineſs of the godly, and the eternal woe and miſery of the wicked.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In likelihood, it is not far off, if we
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:119999:212"/>compare ſome Texts, and our times, as <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.37, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, &amp;c. The truth of it is, were but <hi>Rome</hi> ruinated, and the <hi>Jew</hi> called, what ſhould hinder that great day? And in how little time can the Lord effect theſe two great works? But touching the preciſe day, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.36. But why doth the Lord conceal this day? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That he might hereby bridle our curioſity, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7. 2. That the wicked might not defer their repentance, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95.7, 8. 3. That the godly might be occaſioned to continual watchfulneſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. The third queſtion. Who ſhall be the Judge?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> God. All the Perſons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: All the three Perſons ſhall judge, as touching their conſent and Authority; but the particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of this judgment is committed to the Son; it is he that ſhall execute this vengeance, and as he is the Son of man, <hi>John</hi> 5.22, 27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. and 17.31.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, the Apoſtles ſhall judge the twelve tribes; but how? to wit, by their Faith and Doctrine; the example whereof wil take away all excuſe from the Iſraelites:
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:119999:212"/>2. They ſhal be as Juſtices on the Bench, and conſent to Chriſts judgements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The Saints ſhal judge the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, 1. As ſitting with the Judge, and approving of his ſentence, as the Apoſtles before. 2. As they are Members of Chriſt the Judge: and 3. As their example ſhall be alledged to condemn the wicked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and laſt queſtion. What ſhal be the manner of proceeding at that day?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That we may the better reſolve this queſtion, we are to conſider. 1. The <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this judgement.</hi> 2. The <hi>judgement it ſelf.</hi> The <hi>Preparation</hi> is twofold, 1. Of <hi>the Judge.</hi> 2. Of <hi>them to be judged.</hi> The <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Judge</hi> conſiſts in four things. 1. In the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> he hath from his Father, (<hi>John</hi> 5.27.) which then ſhal be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the world. 2. In the <hi>cloathing</hi> of his Humane Nature with a wonderful Majeſty and glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.28. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. In his <hi>Train,</hi> which ſhal be <hi>thouſand thouſands of Saints and Angels,</hi> and that in their ſplendor and beauty; <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>Jude</hi> v. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. 4. In the <hi>choyce</hi> of a place where to ſit, and the <hi>erecting</hi> of a glorious Throne whereon to ſit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:119999:213"/>Thus much touching the <hi>Preparation of the Judg.</hi> Now for <hi>them who are to be judged;</hi> they muſt be prepared four wayes: 1. By <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> or <hi>Summons.</hi> 2. By <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> 3. By <hi>Collection.</hi> 4. By <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>Citation</hi> or <hi>Summons,</hi> which ſhal be a great ſhout from heaven, <hi>John</hi> 5.28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. As Chriſt now uſeth the Miniſtry of man, ſo then he wil uſe the Miniſtry of Angels.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Upon this ſhal follow the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> Every thing ſhal give up its dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.13. And ſuch as are found alive ſhal be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>They ſhal not dye, but be changed;</hi> and not in regard of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but in regard of <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Upon this ſhal follow their <hi>Collection.</hi> The raiſed and changed, all, both Elect and Reprobate, ſhal be gathered by the Angels from the four Winds of heaven, from every place under the ſun, and convented before the Judge, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. and 25.32.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſhal be the <hi>Separation</hi> betwixt the Elect, and the Reprobate; the Elect to go on Chriſts right hand, and the Reprobate enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to his left, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32, 33. Thus much for the <hi>Preparation</hi> to this judgment, (the <hi>preparing of the Judge,</hi> and <hi>them to be judged.</hi>)</p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:119999:213"/>
                  <p>Now we come to <hi>the judgment it ſelf:</hi> Wherein conſider three things. 1. By what Law man ſhal be tryed. 2. By what Evidence. 3. What the ſentence ſhal be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Touching the firſt, Such as never heard of Chriſt, muſt be tryed by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (thoſe Notions being ſufficient to make them inexcuſable) <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. Such as have lived in the viſible Church, ſhal be tryed by the written Law and the Goſpel; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Job.</hi> 12 48. The abſolution of the godly, ſhal be principally according to the Goſpel, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Law; the condemnation of the wicked, ſhal be principally by the Law; but ſhal be confirmed by the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now we paſs to the ſecond, By <hi>what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? Anſw.</hi> By the opening of three books. 1. The book of Gods <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> 2. The book of <hi>Conſience.</hi> 3. The book of <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Election. Rev.</hi> 20.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing the <hi>Sentence,</hi> what it ſhal be: See the ſentence that ſhal be paſſed upon the godly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. And ſee the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that ſhal be paſſed upon the wicked, <hi>Matthew</hi> 25.41. Thus we proceed to the Uſes.</p>

To exhort the <hi>godly,</hi> not onely to grow in love one towards another, but more and more to deſire ſociety one with another; and the reaſon is this, becauſe the time is coming, when they muſt live together, and that for evermore. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts godly Husbands, to
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:119999:222"/>carry themſelves lovingly towards their godly Wives; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.7.5. To exhort all the <hi>godly</hi> in any caſe to labour heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to uſe the world, as though they uſed it not; feelingly to know and profeſs themſelves to be Strangers and Pilgrims here, and ſo they wil manifeſt that they wait for this Kingdom, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. from <hi>v.</hi> 13, to <hi>v.</hi> 17.

To exhort the <hi>godly,</hi> that they earneſtly ſtrive with all patience to undergo afflictions and croſſes: when it ſhal pleaſe God to reach out unto them a cup of afflictions, and bid them drink a draught of it to the bottom, the meditation of this heavenly Kingdom muſt be as Sugar in their Pockets, to ſweeten the Cup withal. See again <hi>Romans</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. I could be content (ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine)</hi> to endure the torments of hell, to gain this joy, rather then to loſe it. <hi>Ignatius</hi> (as ſome ſay, <hi>Pauls</hi> Scholar) being threatned as he went to Martyrdom with the cruelty of torments, anſwered with courage, <hi>Fire, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Beaſts, breaking of my bones, quartering of my members, cruſhing of my body, all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Divel together, let them come upon me, ſo I may enjoy the Lord Jeſus and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Theſe ſix wayes (from the Doctrine

Now we come to exhort the <hi>ungodly,</hi> ſuch as (for the preſent) are ſo; to exhort them to conſider of this Kingdom, of this heavenly Kingdom, the excellency of the place, the evils which all the godly ſhal be freed from there, and the good they ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy there; and wil they loſe this Kingdom for a little labour, come ſhort of it for a baſe luſt? are the <hi>pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,</hi> to be compared with the <hi>everlaſting joyes of heaven?</hi> nay, to be compared with the inward conſolations that the godly have in this world? <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.

Why then, that thou mayeſt be acquainted with Chriſt, nay, marry Chriſt, that thou mayeſt be brought to a Legal contrition, nay, to an Evangelical contrition, and ſo made fit to be eſpouſed to Chriſt, thou muſt in the outward means take the Kingdom of heaven by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.12. conſtantly attend to <hi>the word of the Kingdom,</hi> (for ſo it is called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19.) imitating them we read of, <hi>Luke</hi> 51.
